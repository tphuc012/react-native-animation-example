1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,860
Sometimes when using animated We want an animation to take immediate effect.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,830
However it's inside of an interpolation and not necessarily capable of using set value in order to do

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,040
this.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,360
We use a point ninety nine cliff but we have set up here is a box that will drag when it stays on this

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:17,750
site.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:24,380
It will stay a particular color and when it goes to this side it will turn red and flip over first thing

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:24,970
we need to do.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,350
Set up an animated value x y that we can store our drag position in.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:37,970
So we set up some animation onstage an animated value X-Y And now we need to set up our pan responder

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,710
and we can do that in component will mount.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:50,930
So just sign this dot underscore Panne responder and I have a helper Sculpin create this will initialize

12
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,090
a responder.

13
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:59,660
And here because we want to preserve our drag location we'll say this state animation but extract offset

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,270
that way to move our delta on our animated value into our offset so that next time it will repair or

15
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:13,140
move to store the new Delta we will need to do anything under these so we can move that and then we'll

16
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:19,600
use animated events and we will pass and no because we don't need anything off the event.

17
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:27,520
We just need stuff off of our state which is a second pass DX into this state animation X and our D-y

18
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,880
into this state animation.

19
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:39,230
Why now that we have our panel responder already for movement we can go ahead and first spread our panhandlers

20
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,830
on to our enemy to view.

21
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:46,750
So we'll see what the spread this Duckpin responder and pan handlers.

22
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,360
Not just because you spread the sand does not mean that we're ready to actually drag it.

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:58,100
We need to do it translate translate translate translate wise with say Konst animated styles or transform

24
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:09,180
and the animated x value x y has a helper function so we'll say dot dot state animation done get translate

25
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,490
transform.

26
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,560
This would turn a two objects inside of an array.

27
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,500
So we spread them into a new array because we'll apply some other transform player and I just have to

28
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,690
translate X and translate y for us.

29
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,190
And now that we have our animated styles already we can apply them to our animated view.

30
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,620
And if we refresh we can drag our box around.

31
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:38,240
Now as we drag this box around we have half of the height here in half the height here.

32
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,370
So we're going to get the height of the window with our dimensions get

33
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,770
and that way we can craft an input range that will be able to calculate the exact spot that we need

34
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:58,840
to do our point ninety nine cliff and because our input range will be used for both the background and

35
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,350
the scale interpellation we can just say Konst input range and get array here.

36
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:13,180
And the idea behind the point anyway cliff is that you define a value which is our start and then define

37
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:18,130
a second value right before the other value needs to take effect.

38
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:28,290
So in our case that's going to be the height divided by two minus 50 point zero one and the fifty point

39
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:36,690
zero one comes from this box being 50 by 50 and then we'll finish this off a high divided by two minus

40
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,100
50.

41
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:45,570
That way this sits at a point nine nine and then immediately toggles over to the next level.

42
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:55,510
So if this was say two hundred and fifty this would sit at one ninety nine point nine nine and then

43
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:00,080
this would then say we need to kick off a new input range at 200.

44
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,670
Well then finishes off with height.

45
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:09,360
So now that we have our input range set up we can actually craft our interpretations so essay contest

46
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:16,830
background color inter-relate and we'll trigger that off of that state animation.

47
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:22,310
Why inter-relate will pass in our input range here.

48
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:29,320
And then the other key part of the point ninety nine cliff is having an output range that is either

49
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:36,800
is the same here if you want the animation is to be the same or just defining something that will immediately

50
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,910
take effect on the other side.

51
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:47,130
In our case we want to have the same color when it's from 0 which is up here to half the height which

52
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,060
is right here.

53
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:54,470
And then as soon as it hits this cliff it will flip over to a pure red color.

54
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,600
So now we can take this background color and interpolate and pass it into our animated styles.

55
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:08,570
So if we refresh back here we now have a blue purple box that you can drag and as we drag as soon as

56
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:13,410
we hit our point any cliff we can see that it turns red immediately.

57
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,020
There is no animation that takes effect.

58
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,320
It flips to red.

59
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,640
Now we'll add one more interpellation will do a flip interplay so say conc flip and interpolate.

60
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,100
So you could do this state animation.

61
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:36,000
Why and interpolate passenger input range and then our output range will be one and one because this

62
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,520
will go into scale and we want it to flip and then negative one negative one which will flip it over

63
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,780
a reflection point.

64
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,210
So pass that in here to our transform.

65
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:54,750
A scale here with our Phlip interpret and if we refresh grab our box and drag as soon as we hit this

66
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,500
line you'll see that our box turns red and flips over.

67
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,050
Now if we don't have an immediate point nine nine cliff.

68
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:14,490
So for example if we were to rather than have in minus 50 here and just have a point 199 roughly point

69
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:21,330
ninety nine to two hundred and fifty if those were the actual numbers then a gradual animation will

70
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:21,690
happen.

71
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,060
And that's not what we want.

72
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,920
So if we refresh this this will now be fifty point zero or 1.

73
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:33,350
So there's a point there and unclear but there's not an immediate point zero one more.

74
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,920
On the other side and this will then actually cause an interpellation to happen.

75
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:45,450
So as we get closer and closer you can see that as soon as you get within 50 years the box touches it

76
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,580
will shrink down and then grow on the other side.

77
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:55,700
But once we add back our cliff our animations will take immediate effects.
