00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,730
When dealing with animations and physics there may be times where you want physics to be applied but

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,880
over a set period of time.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,930
So we have a duration of 500.

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:16,780
However with spring for example you don't necessarily know the time that it's going to take but with

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:23,710
a timing animation combined with easing we know the exact physics that will happen but also the exact

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,630
duration that will happen.

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,130
These will all be very specific to your use case.

8
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:35,790
Take a look at what the default animation would be for just doing a translate Y would just move off

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,880
of the screen.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:47,150
But if we add easing will use easing that back to start it'll move backwards refresh and move backwards

11
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,260
and then zoom forwards.

12
00:00:50,090 --> 00:01:00,820
We can use bounce refresh and we can see it bounced some of this to 300 instead can move bounce to elastic

13
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:10,910
and it shot past and then came back and then we can also do arbitrary Bezier curves.

14
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:16,910
So these are all going to be very specific to your use case so read about easing the documentation will

15
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:22,820
point you to easing dot net which allows you to craft different evenings and see how they will apply

16
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,720
to your timed animation.
