1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:09,130
Let's take a look at this animation we have a button and when we press on that button there is an animation

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:17,320
that takes in effect in the background and it has b inside the button and in between the text and the

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,190
background of the button.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:27,310
In terms of a breakdown we can see that there's likely a single animated value that's animating from

5
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:35,890
say 0 to 1 and that is having an interpolation for a different view that covers the background here.

6
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:46,070
Then we can see that there is a with interpellation and likely we have a view that is top left and bottom

7
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:53,330
of the zero and then we interpolate the with and then at the very end we can see that it fades out.

8
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,770
So that's likely going to be a secondary animation an animated value.

9
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,440
So there's actually two animated values here.

10
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:07,930
One for the background color and the width and then a second to execute after the animation is completed.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,170
To fade out that particular progress bar.
