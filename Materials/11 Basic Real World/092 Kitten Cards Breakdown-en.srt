1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,770
Rather than breaking down actual tinder and exposing a bunch of people's information we're going to

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,800
just focus on the application that we're actually going to build.

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,920
Now the first thing that we should do is break down all of the pieces that we see.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:18,880
We have a card here with some sort of chteaux kind of indicating that there's some depth and then additionally

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,030
we have two buttons that you could potentially press and say yes or no to what you're currently looking

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,080
at.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,410
This is a very classic drag to make a decision animation.

8
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:36,550
So in one case you can see that we can drag this card in as we drag it a few things happened one the

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,480
card is rotating and the image is fading out.

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:49,540
We can see that the image is slightly fading out and at the same time as we drag to the right there's

11
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:57,770
some text that's also rotated in the opposite corner of where we're dragging towards that is coming

12
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,340
in.

13
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:05,790
And it has a opacity as well as a scale that does not appear to be any rotate on it.

14
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:12,960
Now if we move back here you'll see that the opposite happens for a different corner but a different

15
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:13,960
text.

16
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,990
When dealing with just your animations.

17
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:23,090
Make sure to kind of analyze exactly what's happening based upon the direction that you're moving.

18
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:29,420
So for example US moving up or down in the y direction nothing is actually happening but we move in

19
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,030
the x direction.

20
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,930
We see that that's when effects take place.

21
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:40,730
It's unlikely that there will be an interpolation off of the animated value x y x value while we drag

22
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:48,720
also think in terms of interpellation with extrapolate as we move this way.

23
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,090
We see that the rotate is affected.

24
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:57,730
However after we get to a certain point it does not rotate anymore so there's likely an extrapolate

25
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,080
clamp there.

26
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:05,880
And same for the left side when dealing with gesture animations.

27
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,770
There are generally three pieces.

28
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:13,260
The start that Grant on Penn. responded grant which we would typically might call extract offset if

29
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,720
we were to move something and put it there and it would stay the move that there's things happening

30
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,100
on move.

31
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:29,130
And then the release we can see here that we on release on our release we have a animated effect back

32
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,730
towards the middle so we know that there's going to be a unpin response release.

33
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,770
We know that there's movement happening so we will be doing stuff with her on Panne respond and move.

34
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,210
However it does not seem to be any sort of sticking in our on Pan responder Grant.

35
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,860
There's no animation that happens when we pick this up.

36
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,380
And so we know that we likely won't have an on panderers responder grant to do anything when speed initiate

37
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,100
our first touch.

38
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,860
That's all for when we pick it up and drop it down.

39
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:05,460
Now what happens if we actually answer a question and see that when we dragged and released.

40
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,850
There was a movement.

41
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,650
We didn't exactly drop it and it didn't stay.

42
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:19,830
We kind of threw it and it continued on so we know that in our and on Pen respond to release when we

43
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:25,170
haven't gone a certain distance that it is it will bounce back to the middle.

44
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,360
However if we go a certain distance then there's likely going to be a decay or some sort of philosophy

45
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,780
to make our card move off the screen or move in a particular direction.

46
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:42,030
Let's reset and we can see that there's one final animation to break down.

47
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:51,130
When we inspect these two cards you don't see the other card and this one behind it seems to be slightly

48
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:58,650
smaller so we know that there is a slight scale on that animation or that card back there.

49
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,720
That is keeping it slightly smaller than our front yard.

50
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:12,370
When we release just watch the card and see what happens we can see that it kind of scaled in from a

51
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:17,500
smaller spot and had a slight spring animation so we can take a look at that again see the one back

52
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,510
there smaller.

53
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:28,870
We release it sprung in so we know that with our animation after we make a decision that that card back

54
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:35,800
there has a scale applied to it and that a spring animation this is happening on it to bounce it into

55
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,680
place.

56
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:44,020
Overall this is one of the more complex and involved animations just because there's a lot going on

57
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,710
but it makes it easy to kind of dissect each individual action as you're doing it.

58
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,640
So first off we can see that there's nothing happening.

59
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,880
Move drags in particular directions.

60
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:05,020
Top up and down left and right and then do releases and kind of break down each particular thing that

61
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,380
you know of and map it back to ideas that you know and ative.

62
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,090
So we know that there's going to be panners bonder here.

63
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:18,610
There's going to be opacity that there's going to be scale once we answer and there's scale right there.

64
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:25,300
So being able to analyze and write down all these sort of techniques and mapping it back to what you

65
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:32,530
know how to use an animated will be able to make you break down any animation and rebuild that.
