1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:07,930
This is an animated questionnaire and we'll see that when we press on any of these.

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:15,510
We animate one question out and one question in and then additionally we see that a progress bar happens

3
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,150
down here

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,980
in terms of a break down to animated values and effects that are happening just translate why that's

5
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,400
happening.

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,010
So this one is moving off screen.

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,330
And then there's another one like the running of over here that's translating in and then a swap will

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:38,820
happen once this translates into who you can see that an animation will take this one off the screen

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,670
while another one comes in and then we can swap it and put the information that came from over here

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,910
right here and then render our next question to answer over here.

11
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:55,560
Now the progress bar is probably just interpretating off of the number of questions asked for a with

12
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:03,060
and so we can do all of this with a single animated value and then we can see what happens when you

13
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:07,720
press X and then everything just resets instantly.

14
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,780
Yes no yes yes.

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,130
And animate all of our questions out of the way.

16
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:19,930
The idea for this animation and inspiration came from you eye movement which links to the original source

17
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:27,520
which is Robbie Pierce on dribble and an easy way to check out any animation a breakdown of the animation

18
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,280
is to open it up in Preview.

19
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:37,370
So if we open up our shift it takes each Jiff and breaks it down frame by frame.

20
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,900
And so you can you can step through the frames and actually see the transitions that are happening.

21
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:51,640
So when you press on the yes we see that a slight opacity is changing and we can watch as each frame

22
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,810
happens.

23
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:59,260
So we see that in this frame we know that two questions are rendered at the same time because we have

24
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:07,390
one here and then we can see the second one coming into frame and then we can see it move over and sit

25
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,800
in its final position.

26
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,660
And this is just an easy way to see each frame by frame.

27
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,860
You don't have to look at all of them but for a given frame you can see what exactly is happening and

28
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,050
what sort of effects you need to recreate.
