00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:07,430
Some common animations that occur are on Mount animations so basically animation happens to kind of

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:14,120
focus your attention on a particular item of importance to this happens in Google now cards or in some

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,840
cases form fields like we have here.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:26,050
So now if we refresh and see that each of these staggers in its opacity and has a slight movement one

5
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,290
of my favorite features is the zoom feature the access feature on Mac.

6
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:38,310
So we're going to zoom zoom in on our form field and then when we refresh can see that there is a slight

7
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,280
movement we start up here.

8
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:48,250
And then it animates down about five or so offset.

9
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,660
So in terms of a breakdown each of these could be an interpolation but we'll set it up as each individual

10
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,260
estimated values so we can use daggar.

11
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:03,930
And then it looks like there might be an interpolation on the zero to one of the animation that offsets

12
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,610
each of these about five and then transitions.

13
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:15,210
And that's a saw common technique is you set up your thing using lay out and then you set values that

14
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,510
will offset it to begin and then animate it back in.

15
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,990
And that way you don't have to control the positioning of your of your item you just let the layout

16
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,120
take effect and user translates to offset it correctly.
