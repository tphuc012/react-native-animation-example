1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,920
The first thing you're going to do is define our animated value so say state equals animation animated

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,580
value that defaults to zero.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:15,890
This will control the animation for the color as well as the progress of the width across the screen.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,290
Rather than diving into animating this value from 0 to 1 using a timing Lets first set up the progress

5
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,090
bar and the interpellation so that we can see the effect when it happens.

6
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,220
So let's come down to surrender and set up a progress inside of our button.

7
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,100
We have a button here and our text here.

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:42,030
And so in our break time we can see that the progress needs to happen before the button text.

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,890
Otherwise if we put it after the button text as the background animated our button text would get covered

10
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:48,470
up.

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,380
So we're going to say View style equals style sheet.

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,870
Absolute fill.

13
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,680
This is a helper function for us that does position.

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,990
Absolute left top right and bottom zero.

15
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,500
It's just going to define a view that covers this entire thing so that when we use our with percentages

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,950
that it doesn't overflow outside of here.

17
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:19,450
And now with that set up we can set of our animated view and give it a style is styles that progress

18
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,690
which we will go set up.

19
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,320
Now this will be our progress bar.

20
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,240
So we want it to be absolutely positions

21
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,420
and then we want it to be left and top zero.

22
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:43,220
This will then allow us to control whether or not we want an animation to go left and right from top

23
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:48,380
to bottom or just cover the bottom of the screen and we'll change those animations later.

24
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:54,060
So it was a top zero and left zero with that set up.

25
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:02,970
We're able to now go put build our progress style so our progress style consists of a interpolate on

26
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,040
the percentage.

27
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:15,770
So will say this that state animation interpret the input range 0 to 1 output range will be zero 0 percent

28
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,840
to 100 percent.

29
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:23,620
And then we will do an extrapolate clamp here in case 0.

30
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,690
The animation goes beyond 0 or 1.

31
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,190
We don't want this going to be a negative percentage or a percentage over 100.

32
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:37,140
We'll then set up our background color and templates for sequence color and interpolate to this state

33
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:43,140
that information interpolate armpit range is going to be 0 to 1 again.

34
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,600
And then our output range is going to be 2.

35
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:54,780
RG be colors these colors can be whatever you want as long as they are G-B R-Ga. or HGL so that interpellation

36
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,660
will work on them.

37
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:04,250
Now with these two values set up we can set up our progress task to say Konst progress style and we'll

38
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:10,910
give our with with our progress interpolate which will be between 0 percent and 100 percent.

39
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,480
We'll then have a bottom of zero for this particular animation.

40
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,290
So now we have our lefts and top applied styles up progress and now we'll just apply a bottom here so

41
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:25,970
that as our percentage our animation will go across this button and then we'll pass it back on color

42
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:33,340
with our color and interpolate past this and to our progress bar.

43
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:38,150
And now it started on what happens when we actually press our button in real life.

44
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:43,200
This is going to be controlled by some sort of a sink progress operation that you have going.

45
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:48,840
So when the user presses on this button again we're just going to reset everything and restart our animation.

46
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,800
This kind of is up to you on implementation.

47
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:59,990
So we're going to do is say this state animation set value of 0 and then will trigger our animation

48
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:10,090
our animated timing so animated timing pass and this state animation to value of one.

49
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:16,340
I'll just give it a duration of 1300 milliseconds and then we'll call start.

50
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:24,050
If this were a real implementation you might do an animated timing and set the value to whatever the

51
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:32,280
percentages would be like point for point five point six and you're continually triggered this animated

52
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,010
timing over a smaller amount.

53
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,430
But we're just going to animate it to one.

54
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,830
So now when we refresh this and we click on our button we can see that our animation is taking effect

55
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,710
but nothing happens when the button is completed.

56
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,600
We don't have a opacity yet.

57
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:56,040
So to do our opacity will first set up another animated value to animated value with a default of one

58
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,160
because we want the bar to be visible when we first operate across the screen.

59
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,450
And then once completed fade out.

60
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,350
So then we'll come down here to our progress style and apply our opacity.

61
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:19,660
So this state that opacity and then inside of our timing will need to specify a callback which its first

62
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,500
argument is an object with finished.

63
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,760
True or false.

64
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:33,400
If we have finished and we weren't interrupted by another press we'll say animated timing state or past

65
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:42,010
city and our value will go from one to zero settle fade out over a duration of 200 milliseconds.

66
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,700
OK I'll start on this.

67
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:52,390
Now to also reset this value back to one we're going to need to do this state animation or this state

68
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:59,180
that opacity that set value to its default of one.

69
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,920
Now we can go ahead and refresh this.

70
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:06,810
And when we press on our button will see our animation go across the screen and then fade up.

71
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:13,290
And then any time it stays in that particular setting and then any time we want to press on this again

72
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:19,070
our values will reset right before we start doing our timing and our opacity again.

73
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,070
So we can click on it and see that it reset.

74
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:28,860
So we don't want to do an animated timing on this zero back to here on this you want to watch this Doraine

75
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:36,420
but that's not what we're setting up now because we're working with a with a percentage that doesn't

76
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,000
necessarily apply to just with it could apply to height.

77
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,380
So depending on the animation that you want we can pass these in and modify our style slightly to get

78
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,420
some different animations.

79
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:56,070
So rather than setting a bottom of zero if we change this to right and rather then with the progress

80
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,010
we change it to height.

81
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,490
But that's going to set up as a left and top of 0 and then all the way over here.

82
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,850
So basically the animation will start up here and then animate to the full height.

83
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:17,590
So if we refresh this and we press on it again we see that it animates in a curtain style and then finally

84
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,770
because we've passed this progress stylin as the second parameter we can override styles in the styles

85
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,990
that progress.

86
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,600
So if we wanted this to be a small bar on the bottom of our button will change us back to with of with

87
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,360
the progress then we'll switch over to the top.

88
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:42,660
No because we don't want it to be on top anymore you want it to be on the bottom and that will move

89
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:50,610
our bar to the left bottom and then animate all the way to the right side.

90
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,030
Now we do need to add a height and this height will just be five.

91
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:59,850
It could be any value but that will be a five pixel bar on the bottom here.

92
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:07,740
So if you refresh and sugar are animation that we now have a bar that just animates along the bottom.

93
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:17,210
And finally if we didn't want any particular color we can remove this and remove our top notch and keep

94
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,480
our progress and serve plate.

95
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,780
And rather than our color inter-relate we can just pass in a background color that's R-GA to 55 to 45

96
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,820
to 55.

97
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:33,650
So white with a point five opacity and this will allow a kind of whitish background to go across the

98
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,400
screen.

99
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,700
So this will just ignore color interplay because we're passing in a background color and we refresh

100
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,750
this and trigger our button and we just see a white ish background go across the screen or across the

101
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,080
button.
