1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,120
You're going to take a look at how we can rebuild something similar to the Facebook messengers dragon

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,160
bullheads.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:13,740
So here we have a bunch of different heads and we can pick up the first one and we can drag it across

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,900
the screen and then the others will trail behind it.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:22,320
Each one of them will be staggered just slightly behind the previous one and the all ends up at the

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,090
same location.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,790
So if we break down what is exactly happening here the first piece we want to look at is that yes there

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,790
is a drag that is happening.

9
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:39,600
And the other elements besides this first one do not appear to be touchable and there is a translate

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,670
X and translate Y that is happening.

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:48,420
So that means that we all need to do an estimated value x y for this top head as well as the others

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,720
as well.

13
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,960
There is a stagger.

14
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:58,170
However when we talk about using staggerer with drags we will see that it is not necessarily the most

15
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,700
ideal for draggle animations because of how animator works internally.

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:11,070
So what that means is we'll have to recreate some of the staggerer for those other animated heads behind

17
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,970
it.

18
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,420
We don't see any opacity.

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,300
We don't see anything.

20
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:23,160
We just see a translate X Y as well as a staggered head movement to the exact values that this animation

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,610
is moving towards.

22
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,130
Finally when we're talking about drags there's a few things to note.

23
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:36,590
When you're when you're breaking down a drag animation the first one is does the thing that you have

24
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,000
that you have you're dragging does it stay where it's at.

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,870
If it does stay words then we're likely going to be using an extract offset.

26
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:50,690
And that's going to be in the with the pan response that's going to be in the on Panne responder grant

27
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:56,510
then for the on panel responder move when you break it down to its drag.

28
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,050
Do you see anything else happening.

29
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,930
If you were just dragging a singular head.

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,910
Then we would likely be able to use animated event however because we are seeing multiple animations

31
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:14,740
happening we're likely going to have to craft our own animated set value for this top head and on the

32
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,940
other animation that's happening behind it.

33
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:25,540
And then finally when we when we let go what happens so we can see that that nothing particularly happens.

34
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:32,190
The animations that are set on the heads will continue to move towards the position that we left it.

35
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,480
However that's one thing in the on Penn. responder release that you want to think about is when you

36
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,930
drop your animation.

37
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,540
Look at what happens does this.

38
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,590
When I drop it does it potentially spring to either side like some of the Facebook messenger stuff.

39
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,080
If that doesn't happen then we likely don't have anything in our on Penn. responder.

40
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,100
Now something we could potentially do is change the opacity in the on pain response to grant and then

41
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:03,430
on the release you know shifted over back to an opacity of one just to provide some user feedback.

42
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,440
However we won't do that but just know that when you're breaking down your animations look for what

43
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,030
happens right when you pick it up.

44
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:12,900
While you're moving.

45
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,120
And then on release you can kind of break down each particular animation that needs to happen at what

46
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,650
step.
