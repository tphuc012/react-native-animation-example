1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:06,110
When we press on this box it'll spring to all of the corners.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,470
And so let's break down what's exactly happening.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,960
First off we have an arbitrarily sized box and when we press on it it it starts in the top left corner

4
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:25,300
real move or with some sort of bouncing or spring to the bottom left corner.

5
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,790
So there's a translate.

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,650
Why that is happening but not to translate x.

7
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:39,410
And then once it's in this corner it does a translate X to the bottom right corner and also a spring.

8
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:47,960
And then as it reaches here it will do a translate y back up and then back to its beginning with a trend

9
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:48,620
x.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,740
So it seems here that all that's happening is a translate X to all four corners with an arbitrarily

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,780
sized box.

12
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:03,080
So yes this is an animation that I created but it's still beneficial to see an animation broken down

13
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,540
into its pieces.

14
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:11,660
Another technique we could use is B could record this as a jiff and then we could play it back frame

15
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:18,980
by frame or blow it up into each particular frame and watch the animation happening and seeing the pieces

16
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,780
of each transition as they happen.
