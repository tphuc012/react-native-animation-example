1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:07,000
Animated timing is a nother math function that allows us to nest as much as we want and create formulas

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,200
if we desired.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:14,530
However we're just going to show how to use it rather quickly and we'll say conc random value equals

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:26,430
six and then we will create our new animation and use our animated multiply pass and this state animation

5
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,870
and then our random value.

6
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:38,170
Now we'll go replace or this animation with our new animation and we save this we see that nothing happened

7
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,720
because 6 is multiplying by default which is zero.

8
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:48,700
However whenever we animate this when we press on it it'll multiply by this value that we've given it

9
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:49,480
times.

10
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,990
Each of these steps as it's animating from 0 to 50.

11
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:57,270
So that means that we'll go to 300 rather than just the 50.

12
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:02,920
So we can say we will press on this and watch it go to 300 and then it will snap back.

13
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,690
And then once again we can replace this with new animated value.

14
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,390
Save that and the same effect will happen.
