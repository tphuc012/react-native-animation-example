1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:06,960
That ad is a helper method that allows you to take an animated value and synchronously add an additional

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,560
animated value or a normal value to it.

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:19,990
This is going to help with libraries and other things that require you to pass in values and synchronously

4
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,620
add them rather than using offsets potentially.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,430
And then additionally you can nest these as much as you want.

6
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:33,100
So you could create sort of mathematical formulas for your animated values if you needed to do some

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,420
sort of math based animation.

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,060
So we're just going to take a look at the basic case.

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:48,510
So here we are going to say Kautz new animation is equal to animated ad and the first argument is going

10
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,220
to be this does state animation because that's what our enemy of the value is.

11
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,900
And then we're just going to pass in a random value.

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,280
We're going to say 50.

13
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:05,910
However we're just going to sign this here so we say Konst random values equal to 50 past that are in

14
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:17,670
value and now we can see that if we removed this and switched this out to be new animation when we save

15
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,050
see it shifted down 50.

16
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,950
This will also work with other animated values so we can instead of saying 50 here will say new animated

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,100
value.

18
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,850
And when I save this this will refresh and nothing will have happened.

19
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:42,850
And our animations will still work as normal and this will receive that 50 offset.
