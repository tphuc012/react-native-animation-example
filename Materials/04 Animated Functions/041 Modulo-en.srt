00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,220
Animated modules that allows you to do modulo arithmetic and get the remainder after division essentially

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,590
you do the division of the two values take the result multiplied by the divisor which is the bottom

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,240
number.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,740
Then take the dividend which is a top to him and said tracked out that resulting number the value is

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,320
the modulo.

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,830
Now one of the main uses for this is clock arithmetic.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:33,920
However we'll just do some spinning in our demo so we'll first set up a random value which will assign

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:42,800
to three and then will say it's new animation is equal to animated modulo.

9
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,370
So this state animation and our random value.

10
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,660
And then we'll do an interpellation on this and say Konst interpolated Ziegel to a new animation button

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:07,490
Triple-A input range from zero to three in our output range will be 0 degrees to 270 degrees.

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:14,750
And then we will pass this in as a rotate transform.

13
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:20,430
And now as this animates it will be continually divided and we'll take the remainder interpret it and

14
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,600
then we'll figure out a rotation so we can do that and see that it spins.
