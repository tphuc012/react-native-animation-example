1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:07,580
Animated the event is a helper function that will take a configuration and traverse that configuration

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:13,300
and then call set value on the animated values that you've passed to it.

3
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:18,950
This is typically used with a scroll of view pan responder and anything else where you just need a function

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:25,550
returned and the configuration to traverse the arguments that are called and automatically call set

5
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:33,080
value on your enemy to add value to demonstrate this were going to cause this background to change whenever

6
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,550
things are scrolled.

7
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:43,860
So we have an animated value here on State interpretating from orange to blue over 3000.

8
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:50,060
And that is coming from our style's dark content the styles that content is just some fit content with

9
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,760
a 3000 pixel height set on it.

10
00:00:54,060 --> 00:01:01,050
So on our scroll view we're going to say scroll event throttle is equal to 16.

11
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,530
And this is saying we want our onscreen function to be called every 16 milliseconds.

12
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,330
And that'll help us achieve 60 frames per second.

13
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,730
Now we can define our on scroll function.

14
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:20,610
And typically you would have to do a function here or something else which is then called with an event.

15
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:31,410
We then need to get the native event content offset Y and then we would say this that state that animation

16
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,510
that set value this value.

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:45,180
This is a little bit robust and so we can add the enemy event helper because we are grabbing the first

18
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,490
argument of this function.

19
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,630
That means that we need to say animated event.

20
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,660
We then pass in an array and whichever index of the array that you put your configuration object is

21
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:02,290
going to be the map to the argument order that is called.

22
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:09,830
So because for the first argument we just want this first index put an object here and say a native

23
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:22,170
event within say content set Y and then this state animation and then we This will then traverse the

24
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:30,050
first event argument that gets called and then automatically call the set value on this that state information.

25
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,890
And now that we have this set up for the refresh.

26
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:43,270
This means that as we scroll our enemy values getting set which then this interpolation is being affected

27
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,140
and our colors are changing.
