1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:07,970
Another crucial math function is the divide we'll be able to once again take a regular animated value

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,170
or just add integer and divide our enemy into value.

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,370
So we'll be trend we'll be animating to 300.

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:25,450
So we'll just say a conc random value is equal to two and then Conte's new animation sequel to animated

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,940
divide.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,940
And this state animation and a random value.

7
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:40,700
And now when we pipe this in here and save it and then we will press on this rather than translating

8
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,840
to 300.

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,750
It will only go to 150.

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:55,330
And then again this also works with animated values so say new animated value save that.

11
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,890
Press it again and everything works as normal.
