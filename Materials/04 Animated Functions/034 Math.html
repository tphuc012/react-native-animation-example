                    <p class="lead"><p>Previously <code>Animated</code> had no way to do simple math for animations. In order to do any sort of math you would have had to use a listener with <code>addListener</code> to track the current value and then call <code>setValue</code>. Additionally you could have used <code>setOffset</code>. </p>

<p>The only issue is that this is cumbersome, inflexible, async, and isn't declarative. To help with this <code>Animated</code> had basic math options added. Including <code>add</code>, <code>divide</code>, <code>multiply</code> and <code>moduolo</code>. These can all be used in conjunction with each other as many times as you'd like.</p>





<p>They also can operate on any <code>Animated.Value</code> or simple numbers can used in place of an <code>Animated.Value</code>.</p>





<p>The math functions don't always seem immediately valuable on first glance but because you can compose them you can build out formulas with them. Also because you are combining 2 different <code>Animated.Value</code>s they are able to be animated separately, in conjunction, or whatever is required.</p></p>
