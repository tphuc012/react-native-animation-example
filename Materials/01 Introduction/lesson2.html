<p>Animations can be used to reduce cognitive load, define relationships between elements, provide visual hints, and much more.</p>





<p>The focus of this book is going to be teaching you the <code>Animated</code> library inside of React Native. If you need a reason to animate there are a TON of studies/posts/research on animations that serve a purpose. </p>





<p>Overall animations are generally added later but provide immense value to your users and I will teach you how to breakdown animations, understand them, rebuild them, and implement them in your own applications.</p>





<p>Below I will link to some great resources I enjoyed reading on developing animations that are useful.</p>
