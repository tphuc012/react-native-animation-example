<p>The first one was LayoutAnimation. It is still experimental on Android, but fully supported on iOS. I won't be covering it primarily because of it's extreme lack of control. LayoutAnimation exists purely on the native side. You declare the type of animation that should happen and whenever a <code>setState</code> happens next your animation will run.</p>





<p>This sounds ideal but there is no control over scoping these animations to specific views, or children. That means if you don't want to animate certain elements and they are created/updated on the next <code>setState</code> they will animate.</p>





<p>It animates by comparing the previous layout, to the next layout and then applying the animation. This may be ideal and easy to setup in some cases, but as your application complexity grows you may run into issues.</p>





<p>This is where <code>Animated</code> shines. It doesn't fully run in the native world yet, but it is actively being worked on. It allows you to control and animate specific views. It doesn't use <code>setState</code> so you are in control of when animations start/stop.</p>





<p>There are downsides to both <code>LayoutAnimation</code> and <code>Animated</code>. The main down side is the compelte lack of unmounting animations. With special wrapper components these animations can be crafted but this is less than ideal. </p>





<p>Unmounting animations are still a relatively unsolved problem on both the web and mobile when it comes to React. Ultimately <code>Animated</code> has the most development focus right now, as well as the most flexibility in crafting animations. This is why we'll heavily focus on understanding the <code>Animated</code> library.</p></p>
