1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,810
Set props is how animated works.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,450
So let's go take a look at how we can use set native props.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,790
One thing many people attempt to do is disable a scroll view.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:15,600
However sometimes there's a significant amount of content and calling a state may cause performance

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,720
issues.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,840
So let's take a look at how we can use set of props to bypass set state.

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,370
Now we start by setting and enabled true on our component instance.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,570
And that's because our scroll view here is always going to have scroll enabled defaulted to true.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,910
The key here is that we need to get this scroll which is our reference to our this particular component

10
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,430
instance otherwise we won't be able to call setting of props.

11
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:52,570
So now up in our handle toggle we can just do a scroll native prop's

12
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:03,900
and we need to pass in an object and then scroll and enabled this dot enabled.

13
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,800
We don't need to pass back all of the props that are being passed into the scroll you just the ones

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,150
that we want to change.

15
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:16,980
Now we're always just setting this to you so let's just talk let's say this dot enabled equals not the

16
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,980
start enabled.

17
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,690
So that way if it's true it would target the false and if it's false it will be targeted to true.

18
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:30,090
So now if we go out and we refresh this and see that when we're scrolling in the background will change.

19
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:35,820
However we toggle and we can no longer scroll toggle back.

20
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,170
And now we're back to being able to scroll.

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,330
This also works with styles.

22
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:47,250
Do you know that the style is a single prop so passing over a new style with set props.

23
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:53,720
We'll blow all the sow's away so make sure you send over the ones that you are currently applied to

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,530
the scroll of you not just the ones that you want to change.

25
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:05,120
So let's set up a styles would say style equals an array and styles that scroll.

26
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:21,090
And if we're not unable then we'll say style push styles that hide outs will just say style push styles

27
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,900
that show and then we can pass in our style here to our set native props.

28
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:32,310
So this is just going to tile an array of styles that we're sending over and if we look here our height

29
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,700
and show are just setting opacity of either 0 or 1.

30
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:43,140
So now if we refresh this and scroll be disabled as well as toggling the opacity so we toggle and we

31
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,890
can take it back.

32
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:52,000
I don't recommend using Set native props as in lieu of using set state but sometimes you need to bypass

33
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,040
state and the defense and the overhead that comes with updating all of the views.

34
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,050
So use it but use it sparingly.
