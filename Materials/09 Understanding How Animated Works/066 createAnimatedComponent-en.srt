1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:07,540
Create an admitted component allows us to build and construct an animated version of any particular

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,850
component.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,510
In our case we're going to use the native button and we're going to turn it into an animated button

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:25,670
so say conc animated button is equal to animated create animated component will pass in our button.

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:31,380
And now you can use animated button as if it were a button and any of the values that we place on it

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,820
can be animated.

7
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,400
So we can still press this even though it's an animated button and not our normal button.

8
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:44,220
Typically when we animate we're animating styles however animated also works on props with the button

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:53,290
the color of the text is controlled by the color prop so we can say color is equal to our animated value.

10
00:00:53,790 --> 00:01:00,030
So we need to set up our animated value interpellation for the colors say conc animated color Zegers

11
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:10,670
with this state animation inter-relate input range will be 0 to 1 in our output range will be these

12
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:18,770
two colors and then we'll pass and our animated color interpretation snow and we save this because this

13
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:23,630
is Orange and it is starting at 0 as a default value.

14
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,370
We can see that our button now has changed to orange.

15
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:33,010
And that process or animation will kick off and we'll see it transition to blue and then our Once finished

16
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,310
all transition back to zero

17
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:43,320
a word of warning if the component that you have passed into the animated component does not have a

18
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:50,720
set native prop's call a force update will be called to force all the subtree to render.

19
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:57,180
So what some libraries will do to be compatible with animated is they'll get a reference to a node for

20
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,640
example if we got a ref here

21
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:14,530
and then we would on our class if we were to pass this particular component into an animated value.

22
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:19,820
It's a set native props take our props here.

23
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:30,670
And then call this button set native props props this would only be if we were to say pass and if this

24
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:40,560
was a reusable component and this was our magical button and we were passing it into there that would

25
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,250
then be detected by animated and we would forward it along our set native props to the real actual reference

26
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,020
that we were the real actual native component.
