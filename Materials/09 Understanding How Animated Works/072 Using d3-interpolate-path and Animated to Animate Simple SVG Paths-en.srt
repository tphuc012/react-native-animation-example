1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,100
Animated does not support animating SVGA paths.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:12,720
However D-3 inter-relate does but D-3 interpolate depends on the Dom to parse out the D-3 path.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,190
However there is a D-3 inter-relate path that uses just the strings to figure that out.

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:24,240
So we'll install D-3 inter-relate path and import inter-relate path to either ensure path does not handle

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,870
very complex paths unfortunately.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,490
So we'll just keep it simple by animating a simple circle to a larger circle.

7
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,780
Also use reacting as Fiji because it follows the standards of the web.

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,000
So let's take a look at our under function.

9
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,900
We have a touchable without feedback to trigger a press.

10
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:49,620
We have a SVGA with the width and height of 150 and then we have a path and also we get a ref to that

11
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,860
path so we can call set native props in our handle press.

12
00:00:53,860 --> 00:01:00,610
We have an animated sequence which will start by animating our default value of 0 to 1.

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,210
Will then delay for 200 milliseconds and then will animate back to zero.

14
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,130
So let's set up in our component amount and interpellation.

15
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:16,850
So say Konst path and interpolate is equal to interpolate path that we've imported from the D-3 inter-relate

16
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:26,370
path and will pass in our start path and our path will then attach our listeners state to animation.

17
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:34,150
Add listner which we call with our value and then will have our function and then we'll say Konst path

18
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,030
is equal to path inter-relate value.

19
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,160
It doesn't matter that we are estimating from 0 to 1 and then back to zero.

20
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,240
This listener will always be called with the value that we are.

21
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:52,150
That is the animated value and this interplay path will always take that value and figure out the appropriate

22
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,890
path to give us.

23
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:02,610
So now we can do this path which is our component called Set native props and will update the D prop

24
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,110
and will pass in our new path.

25
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:12,210
Now if we go refresh this we can trigger press on our SPG and see that it expanded to a larger circle.

26
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,030
Delayed and then animated backdown.
