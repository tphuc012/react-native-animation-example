00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,250
Flubber is an amazing SVGA path.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:06,510
Interpolator that aims to have smoother animations in between.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:12,280
Let's take a look at how we can use flubber to animate as CGI pads on Riak native.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:18,850
We have a short path which is a star and we're going to transform it in an animated fashion to a heart.

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:24,100
So the first thing we're going to do in our component amount is set up a path and so say Cotts path

6
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:30,330
interpret is equal to interpret which is from the level of a library.

7
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:40,880
It'll take a start path and path and then we'll configure it with maxed segment length of one the lower

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,400
the number here will produce a smoother animation.

9
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,450
However at the sacrifice of performance but we'll just keep it at one and you can play with it.

10
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,830
If your animations are not being performant now that we have our interpreter you can set up our listener

11
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,300
so is state animation listener.

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:08,910
Get our value creator function and then say Konst path is equal to path and interpolate with our value.

13
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:16,390
And we set this up path that native props and we'll update our D with our new path.

14
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,000
And now when we refresh our emulator and we kick off our animation you can see that will transform into

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,320
a heart and then transform back into a star.
