00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,760
Reacting of ships with re-acting of art bindings However you need to install the art library to take

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,850
advantage of it.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,850
The only issue with Art is it does not conform to the web standards like reacting to Fiji.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,050
So I still use re-active as.

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:19,820
However we use some of the helper methods from the art library that we installed some of the power of

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:26,500
art comes from being able to target both canvas as Fiji via all with the same exact API.

7
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:33,490
It comes with helpers like tweeting that helps you morph SVGA pads from one to the other.

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:39,730
So we're going to take advantage of the CEG path and the tween function from the art library.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,120
So we have our start path which is a arrow and our end path which is a checkmark.

10
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:52,600
So we also have a similar animation and a path rendering our start path.

11
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,990
So again we need to create a path interpolator.

12
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:01,700
So say Konst path and interpolate and we'll say tween.

13
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:09,900
And that takes the start path and the path tween from Art can handle significantly more complex paths

14
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,770
than D-3 interpolate path.

15
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:24,190
The next thing we need to do is set up a empty path so say Konst P is equal to a new SPG path.

16
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:31,610
Then once again we'll set up our listeners say state animations add listener take a function and give

17
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:40,190
us our value and then our path internally has a tween function on it and that will receive the value

18
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,870
between 0 and 1 so say path and interpolate tween pasand our value.

19
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,940
And then it also has a the ability to apply to an arbitrary path and so was a path.

20
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:58,780
Interpolate apply to path and paths in our path.

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:05,370
So this does a lot of mutations rather than being a pure function.

22
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:12,770
So then we just need to call our set of props so we say this stop path set need of props and just D

23
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:19,460
and our path will be to SVGA so it will return a SPG path that we can use.

24
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:24,710
So now one we're refreshed this and we trigger our animation we can watch it transform to a check mark

25
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,050
and then transform back to an arrow.
