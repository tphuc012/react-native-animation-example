1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:08,700
The animated delay function allows us to add a millisecond delay in between a sequence or a chain of

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:18,240
animations which means it can only be used with a series of animations like sequence parallel or staggerer

3
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,360
to use it.

4
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,320
We need to find a sequence of animations.

5
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:31,140
So say animated that sequence which will then take an array of our animations will say animated that

6
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:39,380
timing which trigger this state color animation to value of one the duration of five hundred milliseconds.

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:50,210
Well then say animated timing for this state scale animation so the value of to the duration of 300

8
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,430
milliseconds.

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:01:03,640
So this will cause our animation to change colors and then also scale up well then to an animated delay

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,540
of 1300 milliseconds.

11
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,120
So if we just call star on this refresh we can see what happens this fall.

12
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,920
Both do a sequence of timing So first this one and then this one

13
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,900
the start function would then be delayed 5400 milliseconds while we waited for this animated delay to

14
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,520
happen.

15
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,270
However there's other things that you could potentially do.

16
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,040
You could then use something like an animated parallel or some other sequence to animate more animations

17
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,420
or the same animations back to its starting position.

18
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:50,060
So in our case we'll do an animated parallel and that will take an array within the animated timing

19
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:59,170
and color animation to value of zero which was the starting position with a duration of 500 milliseconds.

20
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:10,290
And then we'll also do our animated timing of this state scale animation to value of one the duration

21
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,600
of 300 milliseconds as well.

22
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:20,520
See here we have a delay in between these two that executed one after the other and then another series

23
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,950
of animations that will then execute at the same time.

24
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:30,960
So if we refresh this you see that this will then wait for 200 milliseconds and then do the these two

25
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,560
animations in parallel.
