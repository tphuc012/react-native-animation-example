1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:07,090
Animated sequence allows us to call animations in a line one after the other.

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,690
So in our case we're going to have a color animation and a scale animation.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,870
They are going to use inter-relate and we're going to go from our tomato to a purplish color and then

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,780
additionally we're going to scale our box out.

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:25,170
So the equivalent of doing an animated sequence with how to sync with us would be to do an animated

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:35,750
timing and say this state color animation and our two value will be one and then duration of five hundred

7
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,620
milliseconds.

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:44,960
The MacColl start here and then because it's going after the animation with a start and then animated

9
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:56,580
timing just at state DOT scale animation which will go to a value of two and a duration of 300 and then

10
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,930
more calls start.

11
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:06,350
So now if we were to refresh this and press on our box would turn blue and then scale up.

12
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,560
So now with animated sequence we can remove all of this weird nesting.

13
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:18,260
And so we can switch this to animated that sequence.

14
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,950
And just like others we will pass in an array of animations.

15
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:31,880
And we will then put our enemy in the timing of our skill animation there and we'll close this off and

16
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,680
then we'll just call start on our enemy in sequence.

17
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:40,980
And so this will wait for this to be completed first and then it will execute this and then our start

18
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,630
callback will be complete will be called.

19
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,890
And so once again we can refresh this press on it and see that this accomplished the same exact effect.
