1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:07,130
The animated Stiger function allows you to execute animations but with a delay of a certain amount of

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,220
milliseconds.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:16,070
So we will stagger it color and scale animation will say animated stagger and staggerer is different

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:23,120
than others and it takes a millisecond count first and then the set of animations that you want to execute

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:32,310
second so will wait 200 milliseconds and then define our array of animations will define our color animation

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:32,790
first.

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:43,710
They animated that timing that state duck color animation to value of one with a duration of 500 milliseconds

8
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:52,440
or second animation will be our Gale animation says the animated timing that state that scale animation

9
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:01,650
to value to the generation of 300 milliseconds and then we'll call start on our stagger now because

10
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,140
we are executing this one first.

11
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,470
We then wait 200 milliseconds.

12
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,870
We then execute this second one which is 300 milliseconds.

13
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,410
So this one will actually complete the scale will complete at the same time as the color animation does

14
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,700
because its delayed 200 milliseconds on a stagger.

15
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:27,520
So when we refresh this we will press that and see that they are staggered and complete at the same

16
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,240
exact time.
