1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,600
Let's take a look at what we currently have set up we've got an animated view.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:09,970
That's our motile instead of that we have a comment wrapping a scroll view inside of our scroll though

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,170
you have some fake text at the top.

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:18,290
We have fake comments in the middle which is just a view with a thousand pixels of height and some background

5
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:18,800
color.

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,700
And then we have some fake text at the bottom so they know that we hit the bottom.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,290
Now in our component will now will create a few things.

8
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:33,410
The first will be this animated which is just going to be a new animated value that we control then

9
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:40,520
additionally will create this dot animated margin is a new animated value as well which will help us

10
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:50,390
add the crushing swipe down effect to our motile and then we'll also create this scroll offset this

11
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,190
Staat content.

12
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,130
And this scroll of view.

13
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:05,640
I will just initialize those all to zero Roughead and we'll set up our stylings for our animated values.

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,900
So I'll say conc spacer style is equal to margin top.

15
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:19,270
And then we'll just pass it on to this animated Marjan will then do a concert opacity interpolate and

16
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:27,550
will operate off of this to animated inter-relate So to take an input range because we can Faid going

17
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,860
both up and down.

18
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:35,510
We'll start our input range it's negative 400 0 and then 400 so that we can use the same opacity interplay

19
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:44,860
for both interactions and then our output range will be 0 1 and 0.

20
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:55,340
Now we can set up our model south so say conc modal style is equal to an object transform which takes

21
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:01,550
a translate Y and we'll just pass in this to animated so that we can control the swiping up and down

22
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,260
or moving our motile out of the screen.

23
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,050
And then we'll also apply our capacity here with our capacity.

24
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:15,830
Interpolate now set up our styles and apply them to our certain views so will create an animated view

25
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,500
here.

26
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,470
Say style equals our margin or space or style.

27
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:30,780
We'll then also add in our modal style to our modal also need to capture some of the data from our scroll

28
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,170
view.

29
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:36,520
So the first thing we'll do is add scroll event throttle and we'll set it to 16 milliseconds so that

30
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:43,660
we're notified every 60 milliseconds that a scroll happened in or on scroll of that callback will say

31
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,770
event and then will assign the properties that we set up above.

32
00:02:48,770 --> 00:03:01,720
So this scroll offset will be equal to our event native event content offset that Y and then will say

33
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:13,640
this scroll view height is equal to or event need event to lay out measurements that height will also

34
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,370
get the content size of the entire scroll of view innards.

35
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:27,800
So say on content size change which will then receive the content with the content right.

36
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:37,190
However we currently only care about the height so say this content height equals content height.

37
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:44,110
Now let's go back up to our component will mount and will simply create a pan responder will assign

38
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,910
it to this not pan responder.

39
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,840
The pan responder will allow us to act on the gestures and when we want to start and stop them.

40
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:59,560
So first of all move the On-Star should set pan responder will focus on the move.

41
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:07,920
Only this will allow us to control when we want to start our takeover of the gestures.

42
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:13,180
So say Konst DIY which is our Delta y gesture state.

43
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:22,590
It we'll get a total scroll which is total scroll high which is a combination of this scroll offset

44
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,450
Plus this scroll view height.

45
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,260
Now we want to set up our conditions for when this pan responder should respond.

46
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:38,320
So we'll say if and our first will be this scroll offset.

47
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,160
It's less than equal to zero.

48
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,030
And our Delta Y is greater than zero.

49
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,300
This one is for when we are at the top and we are dragging downwards and we want to crush our mobile

50
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,040
out of the way.

51
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,630
The second one will be for when we're at the bottom and we're dragging up and we want to swipe it away.

52
00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:00,790
This you can tell by saying total scroll height is greater than or equal to this stock content right.

53
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,550
And our D-y is less than zero.

54
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:12,280
In these cases we want to return true which will trigger our pan responder and allow us to interact

55
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,900
with the gesture.

56
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:20,460
Now it's set up when we actually do our move so we can delete the arm pan responded Grant and just deal

57
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:30,490
with our move say Konst do you I see call to are just your state and if our D-y is less than zero.

58
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:40,760
Will say this animated set value are D-y or Delta y otherwise OutServe fire D-y is greater than zero.

59
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,700
We just control our animated margins.

60
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:50,820
This animated margin not set value of D-y to make them work.

61
00:05:50,840 --> 00:06:01,410
We need to go down toward motile and do our spread of this pan responder type panhandlers will spread

62
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,360
those on to our motile.

63
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:10,410
Now you can go ahead and refresher emulator and see that if we scroll down and once we get the bottom

64
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:17,760
we can swipe our moral away or scroll down and then come back to the top and drag down.

65
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,740
We can actually crush our modal.

66
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,780
Finally we need to control what happens when we release.

67
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:34,170
So we'll get our D-y from our just your state and if our Delta Y is less than 150 which is just an arbitrary

68
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:45,710
threshold it will do an animated parallel we'll say animated that timing on this animated will say to

69
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:52,860
value negative 400 which translate Y will make our our model go up in a duration of 150.

70
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:00,990
Then we'll also do an animated timing on this animated margin and we'll just animate that back to zero

71
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,450
of a duration of 150

72
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:15,730
that will set up our LCF for DUI is greater than negative 150 and our DeWyze less than 150.

73
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:23,900
We haven't gone anywhere outside our threshold so we'll do an animated parallel animated timing this

74
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:37,270
animated to value zero for the duration of 150 and then we're also animated timing this animated margin

75
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,230
to zero.

76
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,960
Duration 150 This will allow us to release and then go back to a neutral position.

77
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,320
Finally LCF our Delta Y is greater than 150.

78
00:07:50,450 --> 00:08:00,980
We want to do an animated timing on this animated and in this case we're swiping down so we'll just

79
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:06,090
say to value of 400 and a duration of 300 milliseconds.

80
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,580
Now I also need to call star on all of these otherwise our animations won't trigger so we'll go call

81
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:17,460
start on our parallel and also cost on our parallel up here for a refresher emulator.

82
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:22,180
You can see that we can crush it and it will snap back or if we hit our threshold then it will zoom

83
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:28,450
away and fade out or we can scroll to the bottom once at the bottom we can swipe it away and it'll snap

84
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:33,270
back if you don't hit 150 or you can hit the threshold and zoom away.
