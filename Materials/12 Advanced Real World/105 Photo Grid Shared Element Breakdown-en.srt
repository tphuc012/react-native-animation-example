1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,660
It common pattern on mobile is a shared element and what is shared elmet means is we have one particular

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:14,100
view with an image and when we do some sort of action that element will transition and appear as if

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,680
it's in the other view as well.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,030
Reac native doesn't support reparenting or anything like that.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,740
So we have to simulate exactly what's happening.

6
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,210
I'll go into the actual technical details in Tauriel.

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,950
However let's analyze this animation from a non re-act standpoint.

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:43,750
First we have a photo grid and when we select a photo let's focus on the photo to start you can see

9
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:50,580
that this actual photo seemingly grows to meet some sort of dimensions appear so free press on it.

10
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:59,300
You can see that it will expand and grow and that there is a white background like like it has basically

11
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,670
pulled right up from inside this scroll scrollable container to the top of the screen.

12
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,480
Then let's focus on the text.

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,780
So when we open this there is the bottom text and it seems like it fades in and slides up and back.

14
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:22,810
So if we select this and if we close this we can watch it so it fades and slides down and then fades

15
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,930
in and slides up and there seems to be a slight spring up here as well.

16
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:34,020
You see little bounce when analyzing these kind of animations.

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:40,620
There may be some significant steps to kind of translate that to a re-act native or re-act slash animated

18
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,690
concept.

19
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:51,270
So we do have to pull apart exactly what's happening and then recreate that interaction using what sort

20
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,120
of mechanisms that we have and that's animated that set state.

21
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:01,620
And that's series of other sort of tech techniques that we've talked about to kind of pull this off.
