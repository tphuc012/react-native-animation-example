1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,490
We'll start by creating a style called Heart position.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,550
Absolute top zero and left zero.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,230
Now go create some parts.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:18,130
So we'll start creating a heart adding and filled to true in style equals styles.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,170
Will copy and paste this six different times.

6
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:33,130
Now go create a function which will call Konst get transformation.

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,760
Animation which will be a function

8
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:49,170
that takes an animation scale y x rotate and opacity.

9
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,370
Now we'll do a series of interpolations on the animation to create or effect.

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:01:01,520
Well first two scale animation and animation interpolate is a function that takes an object in an input

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:08,540
range will be 0 to 1 in our output range will be 0 to whatever the scale gets that gets passed and we'll

12
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:19,570
do our X as well so say concert x animation equals animation interpolate input range 0 to 1 and our

13
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:26,150
output range 0 to the X that gets passed in we'll do the same for R Y.

14
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:34,160
So we'll say Why animation instead and translate to our Y do the same for our rotation.

15
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,990
So say rotate animation.

16
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,430
However instead of 0 we will switch that to 0 degrees and then r rotate.

17
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,290
That gets passed in and finally we'll do our opacity animation.

18
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:58,500
So this opacity animation and will do it to the capacity that gets passed in all set up a return value.

19
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:06,700
So an object will say opacity and pass and opacity animation will then do our transform which is an

20
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,100
array.

21
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,970
I will take a series of transforms our first will be scale lets say scale animation.

22
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:19,720
Our second Oby translate X on passenger X animation.

23
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:28,990
The third will be translate Y or passenger y animation and the fourth will be rotate repassing or rotate

24
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,880
animation.

25
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,490
Now we'll go plier animations to our hearts.

26
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,040
We'll switch all of these over to being arrays

27
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:52,850
and then we'll add get transformation animation and inside of here we'll say this state animations 0

28
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,060
and we'll pass in our configuration stuff.

29
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:08,240
So say point eight negative 60 0 35 degrees and point out opacity because you other hearts will follow

30
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:14,660
the same configuration will just remove the five hearts and replace them with five of hearts we just

31
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,160
created.

32
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,800
Now when you do just each of these hearts to match the configuration.

33
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,510
So first we'll change these so that they are referencing different animations.

34
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,400
We'll change this to point three.

35
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:36,230
This one 2.3 this one point seven and this on the point for will change this one to negative 120.

36
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,200
This one to negative 150.

37
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,890
This one a negative 120.

38
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:47,330
This want to know over 120 and this one to negative 280 for X will change this one to negative 120.

39
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,490
This one too positive 120.

40
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,590
This one a negative 40.

41
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:57,010
This one to 40 and leave this one at zero and Farje agrees this will be negative 35.

42
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,240
This one will be negative thirty five as well.

43
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,020
It's only negative 45.

44
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,780
This will be positive 45 and this one will be positive 10 degrees.

45
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:15,830
Finally we'll change our opacities 2.7 point six point three point five point seven.

46
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,840
Now that we have our hearts set up let's configure our animation and trigger like you first need to

47
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:31,160
create Konst show animations which we start state animations map which will be passed in a function

48
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:39,930
which will give us looping over animations and will return animated thought spring animation.

49
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,750
To value one with a friction of four.

50
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,670
The same thing for a hide animation.

51
00:04:48,680 --> 00:05:00,150
So copy this will say hide animations and will change to value to zero a duration of 50 and will changes

52
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,460
from animated spring to animated timing and then we'll do a reverse.

53
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,860
Our hearts hide in the reverse direction.

54
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:13,840
No coordinate our animations with our bouncing button will say animated up parallel which is a function

55
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,710
that takes an array of animations.

56
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:22,040
And we will delete this and paste or animated spring into here.

57
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:29,550
Parel will cause the rest of our animations to trigger at the same time so will then do animated that

58
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:35,280
sequence which will execute one animation one after another which is a function that takes an array

59
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:44,060
was the animated got staggerer 50 milliseconds and then do our show animations and then do an animated

60
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:50,250
delay which will pause for a hundred milliseconds before it goes on to trigger the next animations.

61
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:58,350
There was an animated Stiger again 50 milliseconds and trigger our hide animations that will call start

62
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,720
on this set of animations will then add back in our callback function and this is complete and say this

63
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:09,520
state DOT scale that set value to zero to reset our bouncing heart.

64
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,970
Animation and when we go refresh emulator and we press ENTER button you can see that our heart bounces

65
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,370
and hearts explode and retracked back inside.
