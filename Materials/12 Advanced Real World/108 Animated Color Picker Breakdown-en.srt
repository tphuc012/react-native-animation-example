1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,170
This is another animation found on you eye movement.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,490
You can see that we have a sort of color picture here.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,680
And when we press on the color there's an expansion out.

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:20,550
We can download the gift here from dribble after pressing on it and it is made by Nick Frost.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,950
So in our actual animation we won't be modifying the text color bold italic or any of that kind of stuff

6
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,090
that can be implemented by you and is beyond the scope of this animation tutorial.

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:39,490
But if we pop open we can see that the animation actually starts at this are really being open and we

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:47,640
get to action and we can step through so we can see here that decompose what's happening we've pressed

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:58,580
on it and this square stays in both views and doesn't change which means that there is likely a container

10
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:07,010
view here that contains both the pulled icon and the headings and all that kind of a button action as

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,700
well as contains the button that's slowly popping out here.

12
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:18,260
So you can see that it starts with a small button and then it slowly scale up.

13
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:27,790
When you see that frame by frame that the input is already there and so we are slowly expanding this

14
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,760
covering box out.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,540
Well these are already there so we know that there's going to be two views one is going to be sitting

16
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:39,790
over the top and then there's one going to be sitting on the bottom which contains our buttons.

17
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:48,000
We can keep slow the scaling that button out until our other icons are completely covered.

18
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,210
Now we don't need to deal with the reverse because we could just use a 1 zero with inter-relations and

19
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,980
have a reversible animation.

20
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,040
But now let's take a look at what the close looks like.

21
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:13,470
So here you can see that we are stepping through and that the box here is slowly fading and collapsing.

22
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:20,320
So the outside box is actually causing is actually pulling in.

23
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,760
And those bold icons and all that kind of stuff is staying in place.

24
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:31,130
Now this may be slightly difficult to do but we can kind of recreate the same exact effect.

25
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:37,810
Also we scroll back we can see that there is a slight translate and scale happening.

26
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:45,080
So it was in one spot and it slowly is shrinking and moving towards the hello world.

27
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,650
And see here now the gap is almost completely gone.

28
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,280
It's now inside and kind of behind it.

29
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,900
And now it's completely gone.

30
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,560
So that's likely just a translate and an opacity on the outside.

31
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:03,980
However we're going to add a different effect with a translate and a scale.
