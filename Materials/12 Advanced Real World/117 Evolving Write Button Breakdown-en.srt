1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,680
This is the expanding right button that I saw on your movement.

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:10,490
If you check out the dribble by clicking on it here you just click on the image will pull up the dribble.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:19,030
There's actually a demo so you can see the code and the demo for the web version of it and sometimes

4
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:19,830
people provide that.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,960
But are going to recreate it in re-acting of using animated rather than CSSA transitions.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,710
So let's take a look at first.

7
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,420
We have it already built here in animated.

8
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,910
But let's take a look at it actually being frame by frame.

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,340
So I download the Jif and I pop it open and sometimes you had you have to scroll through a lot of just

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,600
B.S. that isn't necessary to get to where the actual action happens.

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,040
But first off we start with the right button.

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,020
And as soon as we click we can see that it basically instantly disappears.

13
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,350
So there will likely be either an unmount there or some sort of opacity change.

14
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:08,280
Now stepping through we can see that the bar slowly starts to expand and you can just barely make out

15
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:15,390
the icon so there are going to be a switch some sort of switch between the right button and the icons

16
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,630
and this will slowly expand and it looks like these are covering each other but we can kind of take

17
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:31,730
care of that and eventually we will hit full bar expansion and we can see that now there is a bottom

18
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:35,240
there's a bottom that is already coming out so there wasn't here.

19
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,790
And then once this bar is fully expanded and the icons are basically fully transparent this starts sliding

20
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,810
down.

21
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,760
So in your head categorize and just you could even write these down the steps of animations that are

22
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,140
happening.

23
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:57,360
So we've gone from a visible word immediately gone to some sort of expansion and this could be either

24
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:08,120
a with or potentially a scale x then more opacity on new content in the potentially previous container

25
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,340
and now we have another animation here.

26
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:19,350
And basically it was a two step animation by the way so you can see that this does not start expanding

27
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,870
until we already have this bar expanded.

28
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,960
So in your head think about interpellation this is could be a reversal animation.

29
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:35,160
So from 0 to 1 and using a using a cliff we could prevent this from happening until this bar had completely

30
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,970
expanded.

31
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,280
So now we can scroll through these will scroll through frame by frame.

32
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:53,000
If you just scroll up and down and see that this basically by the second frame there was a start writing

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,790
so we are here.

34
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,580
And then we now have an input.

35
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:01,600
This is start writing keep scrolling and then eventually it's completely out.

36
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,680
So we don't necessarily need to go too much more into it.

37
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,290
We have our buttons kind of completely there.

38
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,940
We saw this expand down and then to do the reverse.

39
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,900
We would just run our version of animation backwards from one to zero and then we could slide this up

40
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,860
and then this would scale towards the middle.

41
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:29,040
Overall though it's important to see the animation frame by frame or to be able to have someone explain

42
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,860
it to you and categorize the types of animations because all animations are going to be a series of

43
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:41,490
either a layout change with width and height or it's going to be a transform or an opacity in those

44
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,280
transforms you have translates which are movement.

45
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,090
So if you see something that is moving position then it's likely to translate if you see something growing

46
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:57,270
then it's either with height modification or a scale x and y modification.

47
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:02,250
And then if you don't see something and then see something and then it's you know an opacity or if it's

48
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,740
rotating then it's a rotate.

49
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:11,370
So being able to kind of break down step by step each particular animation it's very helpful to have

50
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,240
it frame by frame.
