1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:08,920
Start by putting scroll view dimensions an animated film Riak native next will the structure of width

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:16,680
and height from a dimension stock get call which is a function that takes the winter window which will

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,290
turn the current dimensions of the phone screen.

4
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:24,480
Now Lego set up our state an acting structure pretty epic this state is equal to an object will create

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,240
an animated scroll state variable and assign a new animated value with the default value of zero.

6
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:40,920
Next inside of a container will create a scroll view close of our school you and all the properties

7
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:49,180
paging enabled which will cause this groovey just stop on multiples of it's with the horizontal flag

8
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:56,620
scroll event throttle to throttle our scroll event caused to 16 milliseconds and then at or on scroll

9
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:08,910
which will be an animated event which is a function that takes an array for grab native event the content

10
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:17,900
offset and the X of the content offset and assign that to this state that animated scroll.

11
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,880
Now it will create a new file which will call a moment.

12
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:30,780
Yes and inside of will create a new reac component and call it moment.

13
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:39,730
Now we'll go back to our app and we'll import our new file that we created.

14
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,140
Now go under scroll view and inside of it will do.

15
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:55,180
Images map which takes a function which will get our image and our eye will then return the moment file

16
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:04,380
that we created will pass and he for the index will spread our image so we'll pass on our properties

17
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:11,310
little clearer image and our title now switch over to our moment is that we created our import animated

18
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:21,310
dimension's and touchable without feedback.

19
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,930
Now we'll do the same as we did before and we'll say conc with

20
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:33,880
the structure our dimensions Dockett call with the window now could add new style sheets will say conc

21
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:43,170
styles equal style sheet does create a so-called container which will have with the height which are

22
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:48,550
the width of the screen and overflow hidden.

23
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:58,550
Now also create an image style which will add flex 1 and with set to know height set to know no set

24
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:05,570
up or component structure so open this and close it will give our out of you the style styles container

25
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,760
style that we created.

26
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:20,300
Now an animated image which will give the source of this stuff start image style will say styles image

27
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,380
and also will get the resize mode to sign cover.

28
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,560
So now I want to refresh your application.

29
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,380
You can see that images are finally loading and the paging is enabled

30
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,810
no dials for our title.

31
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:52,330
While at a center justify content value of center text draps style the background color of our G.P.A.

32
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,180
0 0 0 and in a passive.

33
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:05,680
Point five padding vertical of 10 and then our title text will be a background color of transparent

34
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:22,180
font size 30 color of white and we will line our text the center now go at our components so we add

35
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:31,600
a view and to give it a style and it be an array and a style sheet absolute fill which will add a left

36
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,710
0 0 top zero bottom zero with an absolute position.

37
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:43,780
So this will cover the image Well then at our styles data center inside of here will then add a view

38
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,530
and say style equals styles.

39
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:57,950
Text wrap and then inside of here will say text Well then you are this top prop's title.

40
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:05,730
And then we will add our style equals styles title and now in refresh we can see that the title of our

41
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:11,110
drink is in the middle of the screen in order to achieve our parallax effect.

42
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:20,670
We need to add a Konst animated style to be an object that transform key takes an array of transforms

43
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:29,490
and we use the translate X transform well passing this props that translate X we aren't passing down

44
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:29,950
yet.

45
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:36,550
And then we will add that to our image.

46
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:43,890
Now we'll move back to the index and we'll create a function which will call construct get interpreted

47
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:54,620
our function and will take the animated scroll the current index and the current amount of images that

48
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:01,930
we have now set up our interpellation will set apart input range will say conc input range is equal

49
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:06,470
to minus one times the width.

50
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:13,600
This will set up the translate X for the image before it is Swype to then will say I times with which

51
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:23,250
will be the translate X input for where we are at the image and then additional do I plus 1 times with

52
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,480
which will be the input range for after we have swept away from the image.

53
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:38,830
Now set up our conc output range and when we are at the first index we'll say 0 0 and then 150 translated

54
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:45,280
and then when we are anywhere else we'll say negative 300 which means that the image will be negative

55
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,870
300.

56
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:54,840
As we're swiping towards it it will then move toward 0 and then as we swipe by it it will be at 150.

57
00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:05,240
Now will return animated skirl interpret will pass in our input range our output range and then extrapolate

58
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:12,750
clamp which means no matter what happens it will never go past zero negative three hundred or one half

59
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,610
or 150 on either side.

60
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:21,660
Now we'll go down for a scroll viewer rendering our moments will set up to translate X property that

61
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:30,660
we're using for animation we'll called Get interpret and pass and this state animated scroll will pass

62
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,560
in our current index and then we pass an image is length.

63
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:42,370
Now if a refresher emulator and we swipe we can see that a translate X effect is happening on both images

64
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:58,000
finally we'll go at a separator style will criticized called separator which will be a background color

65
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,520
of black position.

66
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:14,900
Absolute top zero bottom zero will give with a five scroll to the top and click Konst get separator

67
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:27,260
is equal to the current index which will turn a view which we will say is a self-closing view because

68
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,510
we're putting nothing in the middle.

69
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:39,810
We will give it a key of the current index and we'll say stout equals an array style start separate

70
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:53,810
and then we will say our left is I minus 1 times with minus 2.5.

71
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:57,810
This will cause our separator to be right in the middle of both images.

72
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:09,770
Now we need to render them inside of our scroll view which say re apply no say length is equal to our

73
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,510
images length plus 1.

74
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:21,000
This will create an empty array with the length of our images plus 1 in that so that our separator will

75
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,090
be rendered on the final screen as well.

76
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:31,160
Say map which will be an arrow function will put in something pointless here will get our index within

77
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:36,740
say arrow function get separator.

78
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:46,540
Will pass in our index and now refresh we can see that a black bar is rendered in between each of our

79
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,190
images.
