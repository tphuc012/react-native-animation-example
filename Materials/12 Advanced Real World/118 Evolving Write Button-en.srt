1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,550
Sometimes it makes sense to start with the ending of an animation and then work our way back to the

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,410
beginning view of the animation.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,430
And that's what we're going to do for this evolving right button.

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:16,060
We're going to start by setting up some state and this will be a reversible animation so we'll just

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:21,470
have a single animated value that defaults to zero.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,200
Now because this will be some sort of user input we're going to want to use a keyboard avoiding view

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,740
at least on iOS.

8
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:34,260
So I want to use keyboard avoiding view and we can use the behavior padding

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,890
and the keyboard avoiding view actually acts like any other view.

10
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:47,290
It's just a view that takes styling so we're going to give it some style and the styles of center and

11
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:52,150
this will be centered in the middle of our screen because our container is centered and then we want

12
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:57,880
to center the content that is inside of our keyboard avoiding view and this will allow us when we do

13
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,760
our animation to expand out from the center and I'll point that out again later.

14
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:09,050
So going to the center and just paste in a line item center and justify content center.

15
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:14,910
So the first thing we're going to do is set up an animated view that's going to wrap all of our content.

16
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:21,540
And this is just going to be our editor wraps or is an animated view style equals a array.

17
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,060
Because we're going to add some animation to this later.

18
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,530
Styles editor

19
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,180
and then close that off.

20
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,300
Now for our editors styling it's just going to be a simple border.

21
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,100
So we're going to create our editor

22
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:47,580
and then give it a border with one and then really give it to color and we're going to go R-GA 0 0 0

23
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,510
0 point 1.

24
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,820
Now that we have our editors set up we can start working on the two pieces at the end.

25
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,770
And those are the the bar that contains our buttons and then also our text input.

26
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:09,990
So we're going to go focus on the bar first and let's if we think about this the right button has a

27
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,500
blue background as well as the bar.

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:21,400
And if we're going to animate one away and one in so whether it'd mean the bar that the bar icons in

29
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,000
or the right button that means you can have the same blue background.

30
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:31,600
And because this is going to be opacity there that means you want to have a rapping view that has the

31
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,860
bar on it.

32
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,760
The bar blue bar color and then add additional content inside of it.

33
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:47,120
So we're going to set up a view that has styles up bar and this will be our rapping bar and then we

34
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:55,400
can start putting our other content in here including our toolbar of buttons and then our right button

35
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,110
as well.

36
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:06,710
So for our bar we need to just give it a height and a color and then will do height of 50.

37
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:16,130
So that will be the button height as well as the height of the bar background color of 2 9 7 9 f.f.

38
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:22,410
And then we'll do justify content Center and we'll fix our missing quote there.

39
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:29,200
So now if we refreshed this we can see that there is only the border that we have defined on our editor.

40
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,490
So now we should go and add our toolbar.

41
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:40,390
So inside of here because it's going to be animated because we need to adjust the opacity and faded

42
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,230
away it's going to be an animated view.

43
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:55,650
And we'll give it a style and because we animate it will do in a race who can pass in some additional

44
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,540
animated stuff later and give it styles that toolbar

45
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,600
and then we can start adding icons.

46
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,310
Now I'm just going to paste in our icons that we're working with for the left side.

47
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,430
And if we go ahead and refresh this we can see that we are in a column direction and we don't want to

48
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,210
be in a calm direction for our toolbar.

49
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,040
So let's go style our toolbar to make it correct.

50
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:27,680
So down here we can add our toolbar style and because you want to in a row we'll give it flex direction.

51
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,990
Rowe and to have some spacing on both sides of our toolbar.

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,710
We're going to give it a padding horizontal of 10 and because we want our items aligned in the middle

53
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,910
of the bar we'll give it a line items center

54
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:56,690
free special line items correctly and then we want to justify content flex start and that will have

55
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:02,890
our buttons that are the child of our tool were forced to start on the left side.

56
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:08,790
So we can see that we have some padding horizontal and our buttons are here and we'll see how we add

57
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,470
in our right to our next.

58
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:19,350
So our design constraints are that we have a set of buttons here that are forced to the left and then

59
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:29,320
another set of icons that are all the way to the right depending on the size of our bar here.

60
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:34,440
And so there'll be a gap here once our toolbar is fully expanded out.

61
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,120
So in order to do that we're going to need to create another view

62
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:46,080
and then add our icons in here and we're going to need to apply some styles to this which we'll call

63
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,820
styles that right in inner bar now will add our icons.

64
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,940
And then go style our right inner bar.

65
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,620
Refresh this without actually styling we can see that this is not what we want.

66
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,990
We have a row and now we are right in our bar which is a new view.

67
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:12,450
It is not a dot that Fox direction it's going to switch back to being a flex direction column.

68
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:17,270
So we need to then switch it to a flex direction row so it stays in a row.

69
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:23,790
We'll then give it a line items center so that it's centered and then most crucial will give flex and

70
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:30,900
tell everything to move towards the end and render there and move back towards the beginning of this

71
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,280
particular view.

72
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:39,960
So now if we refresh we can see that our buttons are rendering or this just not take up the appropriate

73
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,960
amount of space because this outside bar view is just arriving.

74
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,710
It's with from the inner content.

75
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,900
So now we need to go fix this so that it actually is the appropriate with that we want.

76
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,770
So we can actually adjust the bar correctly.

77
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,160
So the width of this is actually going to be based upon the width of the window.

78
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,160
So an essay contests

79
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:09,210
equals dimension's does get window.

80
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:19,670
And we're going to define that on our editor and we're going to say with is equal to with minus 40 and

81
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,680
we will need to interpolate on this later.

82
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,110
So this is going to be a temporary value.

83
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,440
So we refresh we can see that we have expanded our bar.

84
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:38,200
However this still is not correct because the view itself that we that we created the right inner the

85
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:46,820
right interview if we can get it the right inner bar view is only taking up this much space.

86
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:53,800
So now that we have a with Applied being comes on here and tell this right in to take up all the space.

87
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,090
Flex one.

88
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:02,190
And now that it's taking up all this space we can actually select that now because it's taking up all

89
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,730
of this space.

90
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,620
We now have a flex one or the flex and tells it to start down here.

91
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,520
Now that we have our bar all set up we just set up the bottom porch portion which is the insert text

92
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,490
input.

93
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:25,910
So we come back here we can set up a new animated view because this is this animated up view will be

94
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,440
will be what kind of slides up and creates that tuck in motion.

95
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,640
And then we need to set up a text input

96
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,270
and we'll give it a placeholder.

97
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:44,650
Start writing as we saw in the break down.

98
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,050
Well then give it a multi line support.

99
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,210
That way we can write on multiple lines.

100
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,720
Well need to get a ref to it that way we can focus on it and blur it.

101
00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:04,730
Whenever we open or close the the editor will say this underscore input was input and then finally

102
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:16,670
we need to give it some styling and we're going to give it the style sheet absolute fill that way whenever

103
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,510
we apply a height to this.

104
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,820
This will cover it entirely and we can then animate this and this will continue to also adjust to the

105
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,250
height that this is.

106
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,260
So we can just give our animated view a height.

107
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:41,890
So with this style equals an array and say styles got lower view and then here come give our lower views

108
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:49,740
some styling and we'll just give it a height of 150 so now and refresh this.

109
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,980
See that we have our input rendering.

110
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,890
And this whole bottom section is 150 and then our editor border with border that we gave it is now showing

111
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,170
up.

112
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:06,840
Now this is touching the sides and we don't want our input to be touching the sides like that.

113
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:13,240
So we'll give our inputs some styling will say padding of 10 so it's padded all around and then a font

114
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:19,680
size of 20 just to bump up the writing because if we wrote on it now would be pretty small.

115
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:28,930
So if we come back here we can apply our styles the input refreshed this and now this has bumped up.

116
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,890
Type of a decent size and it's has some padding on the outside.

117
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,880
Now we have our whole thing set up.

118
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,490
This is what the ending state looks like.

119
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,960
So now we're going to go and render what the beginning state should look like.

120
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:49,220
And that's just going to be a right button that is on top of this bar.

121
00:10:49,530 --> 00:11:00,240
So because we're rendering this bar here this toolbar here we need to render our right button inside

122
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:04,100
of our bar so that it will get this blue background.

123
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,260
And because we want to render it on top of this and we want these to still be intractable we're going

124
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:16,230
to need to use our pointer events technique which means we're going to do an animated view and style

125
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:25,910
it with a style sheet that absolute fill to cover and then we will close that off.

126
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:34,200
And then we will start setting up our button will do a touchable without feedback

127
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:50,530
and then simply just render some view a view and some text that says right and we will need to apply

128
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:57,340
some styling to this so we'll give it style equals style stop button text and style that in a second.

129
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:04,860
And then free refresh means that we are rendering our right button in the top left corner and we don't

130
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,810
want that we want it to be centered.

131
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:12,750
So were to come here and use the same center styling that we used before for this keyboard avoiding

132
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:17,300
view and just give it styles that center.

133
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,000
And now when we refresh we can see that this Riperton button is centered.

134
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,170
So now we can kind of grasp that there's going to be a transition happening.

135
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:31,500
This is going to be shrinking to a particular size and this Riperton will stay right in the middle of

136
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,500
all these disappear and then the reverse can happen.

137
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,340
This will disappear.

138
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:47,660
And these will expand out so quick styling on our button text will just give it a color of white refresh.

139
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:54,780
And now we're ready to go so for the first bit we need to kind of break down what this animation is

140
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,530
doing.

141
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,850
This is sliding up and then this will slide in.

142
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,400
So it is a two part animation.

143
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,500
However we will also be operating the other direction.

144
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,250
So we're going to start at the right button.

145
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,200
So we kind of need to do this slightly backwards.

146
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:16,920
So I'm going to remove this with here because the first thing that happens when we actually open this

147
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,900
button when we press on this button is that this width of our editor is going to expand.

148
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:30,840
So we're going to set up an interpolation for our editors who say conc with interpret state animation

149
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:37,290
interpolate we'll set up an input range of zero because we will start at zero and this right button

150
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:44,780
will be a particular distance or particular with and for half of the animation we want to expand.

151
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:50,970
So output range will be 100 and this will just be the width of that bar when nothing when the button

152
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,300
is closed or when the editors closed.

153
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,750
And then we'll do with minus 40.

154
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:59,170
Now these could be percentages or or whatever measurements that you have.

155
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:05,160
But this is styling for the whole screen right now and then because we are in a many to one and only

156
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:12,610
defining a half of the animation in our input range you want to do and extrapolate clamp.

157
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:21,610
And now we can go ahead and pass this value into our editor like we had before and if we refreshed this

158
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:26,930
we see that now we are starting to take shape of having that right button.

159
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,500
Now we have the right button.

160
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:35,430
The other content isn't hidden yet and the input is now smaller as well because we're affecting the

161
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,610
whole layout.

162
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,910
So still focused on this toolbar.

163
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,970
The thing that is happening is that these buttons are appearing and we don't want them to appear.

164
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:49,240
So let's set up some opacity for that so we'll say it's opacity toolbar.

165
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:56,250
Interpret this as state animation interpret and we'll do the same thing for the input range which was

166
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,730
zero point five an output range.

167
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:06,120
And when the button is close we don't want those icons to show up but after half of the animation we

168
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,800
do and we'll do an extrapolate clamp here as well.

169
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:21,000
And now we can craft our toolbar styles and passenger opacity with opacity toolbar inter-relate bring

170
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,520
these down here and pass them into our toolbar animated view.

171
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:31,770
And when we're refreshed we now have the first portion that we care about we have a right button and

172
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:36,780
now that we're working backwards we can see that the second piece that we need to take care of is is

173
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,900
making this collapse to zero.

174
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:45,930
So up here we can set up two interpretations.

175
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,380
One will be for the editor height so say Ed..

176
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:58,790
Interpret this to state animation and interpolate and we'll put the input range and we won't.

177
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:04,050
We need to do this second because remember the actual animation is click on the right button.

178
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:10,260
The bar will expand and then this will drop down and then the exact opposite will happen when we close

179
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,450
this is this will slide up and this bar will slide in.

180
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,600
So that means we need to do something in the later stages of the animation which is to say point seven

181
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:29,730
to one and then our output range will be 0 and 150 and then we'll also do an extrapolate clamp here.

182
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,600
So let's a justice to say Ed..

183
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:42,630
And now we can craft our editor styling so say editor style to opacity is that state animation will

184
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,750
just have it hidden and then we'll do height and pass an editor right.

185
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,230
Fix this say.

186
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,440
Spell it correctly.

187
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:56,980
And now we can take our editors style and add it to our lower view.

188
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:04,840
And now when we refresh we're back to where we want we have a right button that is just standalone and

189
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:09,710
the interpretations are set up to expand out and drop down.

190
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,790
However we don't have an interpolation yet to hide a right.

191
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,200
That's always going to be visible right now so let's go fix that.

192
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:24,490
So for our button to be hidden We need that to happen in the first half of the animation because as

193
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:32,150
we go moved towards zero to point 5 where our button icons are expanding we need that to hide now in

194
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,130
the actual animation.

195
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,450
It happened really quickly.

196
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,960
It was a very it was a single frame that that right would disappear.

197
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:43,750
But we're going to have it slowly disappear so we're into a conc opacity button interpolate.

198
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:51,160
So you go to this that state animation interpret passenger input range which be zero and point five

199
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:57,970
and because at zero because our starting animation we want the opacity would be one so you can see it.

200
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:02,830
And as it advances to opening EDR it'll editor disappear.

201
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,540
And then also extrapolate clamp here.

202
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:15,840
Now we can create our Konst button styles pass in our opacity and our pastie button interpolate and

203
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,330
then we can go and apply this to our button wrap here.

204
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,480
And now we have our interpellation is all set up and we can kind of see that if we go and adjust this

205
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:33,370
value here if we flip this to one and refresh we can see that we are the do the right buttons gone and

206
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,670
we are in our full editor position.

207
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,120
Unjustice to point five and see what the half mark looks like.

208
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:47,760
We can see that the bar is visible are right button is 0 is gone and we can kind of just step through

209
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:55,340
manually and see what position our transitions are happening at and that gives us a good feeling and

210
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:01,100
we can now go and actually execute a transition from one to 0 for our our right.

211
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:08,870
So let's refresh this back to 0 and on our right button with our touchable without feedback odd add

212
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:17,180
and on press and say this toggle transform and now we will go create a

213
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:27,610
toggle transform and the other portion that we will need to take care of is the pointer event.

214
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:32,460
So once this expands that right view is still going to be absolutely a position.

215
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,420
Now we could control it not rendering and rendering but we'll just use the pointer events technique

216
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,200
for now.

217
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,440
So for our two values they can't say to value is equal to this dot on the square.

218
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:54,580
Open and then do zero and one animated timing and or this state animation to value and then we'll just

219
00:19:54,590 --> 00:20:01,820
do a duration of five hundred and fifty and then we'll call start.

220
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:13,590
And at this point we'll then toggle this open doesn't equal equals not just open.

221
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,280
And then we will also toggle a state value.

222
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:29,610
So we're going to add an open false to our state and then do this Dot said state and open this open.

223
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:33,140
Well just because we talk a here we can just keep doing it at state.

224
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:38,990
Once this animation is interrupted then this will get called if that's if that's possible.

225
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:44,910
So now if we refresh and we trigger our animation free press on right see that we expand out our right

226
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,850
fades away and then this bottom part expands but we don't have a way to close it just yet.

227
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:57,240
We don't have a way to close it but because we aren't toggling pointer events on a right button if we

228
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,410
press on this again we can see that our animation reverses

229
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:11,940
and we can fix that by coming down here to our covering view and just giving our pointer events.

230
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,810
And if it's open then there's none.

231
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,770
And then if it's not then it's odd.

232
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:21,550
So in this case it's not open so it's going to be auto Pressel once it's open and we won't be able to

233
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,730
click it.

234
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:30,630
Now the final important piece is the accessibility of focusing on the input or blurring the input.

235
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,070
When this right button closes because if you keep focus on the input we're not unmounting it.

236
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,080
And that means the keyboard will still show up even though this right button is closed.

237
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:47,200
So we're going to go here and say this that open and do it ternary because we haven't talked with it

238
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,640
yet.

239
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:54,380
This Open is going to be the state of the opposite state of what we're kind of talking about so if it's

240
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,610
open and this is called that means we're heading towards not open.

241
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:05,950
So this input Blair however if it was previously open we haven't really yet.

242
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:17,360
That means that for opening and say this stot input focus and now if refresh and open nothing happens

243
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,210
because we don't have a keyboard or press command OK.

244
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:25,550
And then we don't have a way to close it yet but if we keep our keyboard and we can see that once the

245
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:32,780
animation is done then we have our keyboard pop in and now we need a way to close this view and we can

246
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,050
do that with a close button or whatever you feel like doing.

247
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:40,590
I added this after the fact and we're going to paste this in.

248
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:46,430
It's called toggle transform because we're actually using the same toolbar styles which if we go look

249
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:54,530
at our toolbar styles is just an opacity this will fade in when the toolbar is visible and then fade

250
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,160
out when it isn't visible.

251
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:02,650
And now we need to just style or close button so that it will be a little more visible even though we

252
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,560
have our input here or our keyboard here.

253
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:12,050
We need to make this little more visible so you come down here and do close.

254
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,390
So we'll do two things.

255
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:17,430
We'll move it away from our editor and the keyboard and then give it some color.

256
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:22,310
So say color is this same thing that we have for our bar

257
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,900
and then Marjan top of 10 and margin

258
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,920
bought 20.

259
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:42,880
So now when we refresh can press on our right button expand our clothes will be visible and we can close

260
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,490
it.

261
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:48,200
And once that's closed in that blur is called and our keyboard will disappear.

262
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,510
So some kind of ending takeaways.

263
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:59,350
Sometimes it is easier to focus on the ending state first at the starting state and then slowly transition

264
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,860
each particular piece until you have the exact animation that you want.
