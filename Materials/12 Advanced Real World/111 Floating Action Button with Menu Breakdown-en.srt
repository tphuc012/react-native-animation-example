00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,810
A popular animation is a floating action button with a menu kind of behind it.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:11,640
In our case we have the Starbucks application and when you press on the button the PE text will pop

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,610
out as those two buttons will pop out with order and reload text.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,420
Take a look at this animation and break it down and you can see that when we press our pay button let's

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,780
focus on the two icons.

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:31,470
First the two other menu items the order and the reload are basically already off set and they scale

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,570
up from 0 to 1 at a particular point.

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:42,030
And then the order reload and pay about halfway through the animation will explode out from kind of

9
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,910
inside of the button out towards position left.

10
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,570
Finally there is the background.

11
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:58,740
The background is a circle and it expands outwards and covers the entire screen and it's black with

12
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,650
some opacity so you can still see the background.
