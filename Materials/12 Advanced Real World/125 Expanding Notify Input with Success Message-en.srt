1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,950
Let's dive in and check the state of our application before we start styling it and making it look nice

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,650
we have an animated value as well as a boolean for success of true and false.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:19,040
We have a handle press and we have a handle send Additionally we have a few conditional inputs.

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:25,810
If we're not successful we'll render a text input to surrender the Notify me text.

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,210
However we are successful.

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,760
We'll render a thank you message.

7
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:37,490
The first thing you do is create an interpretation on the width so that we can control it expanding.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:48,720
We'll set up a concert with interpolate say this state and it may not interpret our input range.

9
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,600
We'll have a few key.

10
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:58,990
We'll have a few values zero point five and one this will give us three steps an output range of 150

11
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,540
150 and 300.

12
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,370
We'll then also add and extrapolate claim of

13
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:15,950
will then do cartes button wrap style with and then add or with it.

14
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,320
You can go ahead and apply that third button wrap refresh.

15
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,550
And now we have a default of 150 with on our button.

16
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:32,650
The input is currently visible so we need to adjust it so that it is scaled out of the way said Konst

17
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,860
input scale and.

18
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,480
Of this state and animate inter-relate

19
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:47,180
input range to zero point five point six.

20
00:01:47,180 --> 00:02:00,400
So a three step in our output range of 0 0 and 1 will then set up input scale style which we have a

21
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:06,030
transform of an array with a scale and put our inputs Gaile interpret it in here.

22
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:14,650
Now we can apply that to our interpellation or to our input and now one refresh.

23
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,060
You can see that it is scaled.

24
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,440
All of our stuff out of the way

25
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,500
now we not only need to scale our input but all seem to scale in our center but it's been come up here

26
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,220
and create a contest send button and interpolate.

27
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:40,140
It was this that state and a make inter-relate and our input range will be slightly shifted because

28
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:47,910
we want it to animate in after our input scale our input has scaled and so will say input range and

29
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:56,780
we'll set to zero point 6 and 1 in our output range be zero zero and then 1.

30
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,930
So it'll come in late.

31
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:06,960
So now we can go ahead and set up our contest send button style and do a scale as well.

32
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:16,840
And then we'll apply that to our Send button.

33
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:24,560
And finally before we can actually see this in action we need to create a scale for our notify me button.

34
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:36,380
So we'll say notice Konst notify text scale and interpolate we'll set up this state and interpolate

35
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:42,260
and this we need to scale out quickly before we scale and anything else will say our input range is

36
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:50,180
a two step of zero 2.5 or output range is 1 to zero and we don't want to scale any further so I will

37
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,540
say extrapolate clamp.

38
00:03:53,780 --> 00:04:04,450
Now we'll go ahead and set up comments notify text sound and this will also be a skill so it transform

39
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,650
scale.

40
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:17,980
Pass this and then we can apply this to our animated view that surrounds our text so he calls high tech

41
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,930
style.

42
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:25,600
Let's go to the input scale inter-relate and we will add an extrapolate clamp so that it does not scale

43
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,820
beyond blunt one and now we'll go up here and say animated that timing.

44
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:39,930
So this state animate two value of one or duration of 300 milliseconds and then we'll call start.

45
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:49,260
So now when we press this button our input expanded focused and our button scaled in the final scale

46
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:55,340
will need as far I think you message we want it to scale in as everything else is scaling out.

47
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:06,660
So all do is set up of conc think you scale interpolate because this state enemy bullit and with our

48
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:19,120
input range will go from zero to 1 in our output range we'll flip that around and go one to zero.

49
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,520
This will cause a reverse effect.

50
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,420
So once this is animating backwards from 1 to zero to reset our scale will go from zero to 1 and it

51
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,800
will look like our think is animating in.

52
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:40,220
So say Kotz think you text style to transform with a scale or think scale and interpolate.

53
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:48,550
And we will go apply this to I think you textes.

54
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:58,040
Now when we press the send button handle send will be called so let's implement handles send.

55
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,940
We need to call this state and say success is true.

56
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,130
This will allow our Think New Message to be shown.

57
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:13,500
However it will be scaled out to zero because our animated value is all the way to one at the moment.

58
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:20,040
Then to scale everything out we'll do an animated sequence.

59
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:29,690
And in there we'll say animated timing this does state animate to value of zero.

60
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:38,680
Duration of 300 will also do a delay of animated delay of 5400.

61
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:45,700
Before we toggle everything back MacColl start start takes a function that will be called once this

62
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,410
animation is over.

63
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:55,320
And at that point you can then say this Utset state success false to reset everything back to the beginning.

64
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:03,890
So now we refresh click Notify type in an email click send.

65
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,470
Everything expands back to nothing and then resets back to the Notify me.
