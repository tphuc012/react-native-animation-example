1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:06,470
Even though a rotation is just a number an enemy that values support that we still need to use interpellation

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,020
to define our rotation.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:17,790
So let's first set up a rotation so say Konst X inter-relate to this state to animation that interpolate

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:29,160
our input range is just 0 to 1 and her output range will be zero degrees to 360 degrees.

5
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:38,270
Now we'll set up our animated styles so say conc animated styles siecle to transform passen rotate and

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,070
fastener X inter-relate.

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,220
Well then take this and apply it to our box

8
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,690
so now refresh this we can see this.

9
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:52,310
When I press on it will do a full 360 degree rotation.

10
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:58,910
However we can do a singular rotate or we can operate on the x and y independently.

11
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,640
So if we were to take this rotate and switch it over to just a rotate X and we refreshed this and re

12
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,090
trigger animations we'll see a flip over the y axis.

13
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:17,990
Additionally if you prefer radians as opposed to degrees the enemy of the library also supports radians.

14
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:24,040
If we were to reverse this we'd have the same exact animation because six point two at 3 1 9 radians

15
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,280
is the equivalent of 360 degrees.

16
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,250
So let's convert this back.

17
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,600
I will set up a y interpellation for rotate y.

18
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:38,180
So say Cotts Why interpret is equal to this state animation internally.

19
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:51,600
So input range is zero point five and one will then specifier output range as 0 degrees 0 degrees and

20
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,760
then 180 degrees.

21
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,820
So this will basically wait for our animation to be halfway completed without doing a rotation on the

22
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:06,700
Y on the Y rotate before it then triggers a 180 degrees on the Y rotate.

23
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:16,750
So we then define our rotate y I'm passing a y interpret We then refresh once we trigger this animation

24
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,510
we'll go halfway before it does a rotate y.
