1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,170
With animated animated values are just numbers.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,410
However in order to do colors we must use interpellation.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:14,150
So now let's go down to a render function and set up and interpolate space say conc color and interpolate

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:24,340
to this state animation that interpolate which would take an input Prange and will say 0 1 and 2.

5
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:29,080
That way we can define a three step color when interpolating colors.

6
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:33,430
They must be in R G B our G.P.A. or in HCO.

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:40,570
So we're going to paste in an output range here and we'll have three colors that go from green to blue

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,480
to red or red to blue I should say.

9
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:55,580
So now we can set up cots animated styles which passes into a background color and give it our color

10
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:00,000
internally and then we'll pass this into our box.

11
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:07,460
And because we never specified a value down here there was no value of color for our box now because

12
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:14,770
we did default 2.0 our interpellation will say zero maps to this green color.

13
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:21,670
Now if we press on our box because we have a press to trigger an animation we'll go from zero to 2 and

14
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,520
watch it step through changing colors regardless of what color it is.

15
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,710
It'll figure out how to interpret it to it.

16
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,360
Let's set up one more interpellation.

17
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,840
We don't we aren't able to interpolate off of inter-relations that output colors because the output

18
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,900
of this is not another number to interpolate to.

19
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,540
So unlike numbers we can't do that.

20
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:53,080
So we'd have to say Konst background style is equal to background color and we'll just do an inline

21
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,180
interpellation here and say this state animation interpolate

22
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:10,480
Well then define an input range of zero to two and then an output range of the same exact color.

23
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,970
So they're both a red color.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,600
However all we're changing is the alpha channel value.

25
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:24,460
So interpolate will interpolate and animate just the opacity of this particular color.

26
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,400
Let's apply our background style to our container and watch it take effect.

27
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:34,110
So when refresh we can see that we have this tomato color and animates from 0 to 2.

28
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,490
All that will change is the alpha value.
