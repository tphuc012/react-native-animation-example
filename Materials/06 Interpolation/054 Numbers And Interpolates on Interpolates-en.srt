1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:07,200
A lot of the power inside of the animated library comes from interpellation you're able to do interpellation

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:14,460
on interpolations and it will still be reactive regardless of a timing or anything else that is triggering

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,850
the animation.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:22,840
So let's go down to render function and set up our first interpellation say Konst animated and interpolate

5
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:31,040
is equal to this state to animation which is our animated value and call and interpolate which takes

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:37,490
an object and takes an input range and an output range the input range will be looks at the animated

7
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:44,000
value and then determines how it should be interpreted to the output range the input range must also

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,340
always be increasing.

9
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:56,660
So when we say input range we can do to 1 0 we would have to do 0 1 to interplay input range is not

10
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:01,310
necessary to start at zero it could start at any numbers we could say negative 1 but it is always must

11
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,620
be increasing.

12
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,190
Now we'll define our output range output range can be anything and can.

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,430
Doesn't have to be in an increasing fashion.

14
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:16,220
So in our case we say zero because at the zero mark we don't want anything happening that at the one

15
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:23,950
mark of our animation will say 300 and then we'll bring it back down to zero once we hit to.

16
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,580
So now that we have an interpellation Let's go ahead and set up some animated styles.

17
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:34,670
So I say Konst animated styles sequel to transform here.

18
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,370
And we'll pass this into to translate Y and pass and animated and interpolate.

19
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:49,200
And now that we have our styles we can take this and place it on our box and Zaal and refresh here and

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,680
we trigger our animation by pressing on this animation our animation will run and it will then go to

21
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,850
from 0 to 1.

22
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:02,830
And once that is complete then it will quickly go to two which will kind of reset back to zero.

23
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:13,390
So one thing to note is that when we do an interpellation it returns a new animated value.

24
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,620
What that means is we can interpret off of our interpellation.

25
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,650
So we'll say Konst interpolated interpolate and we'll set up an interpolation to control our capacity.

26
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:33,310
So as say animated interpolate to interpret and we're no longer operating off of the 0 1 2 range.

27
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:40,540
We're actually operating off of the zero 300 0 so the output range of an interpret will become the input

28
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,280
range of another inter-relate.

29
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:54,070
So that means our input range will be 0 to 300 and our output range will be one to point five.

30
00:02:54,230 --> 00:03:02,930
So this will map to an opacity and this will basically as this moves towards 300 This will move towards

31
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,420
from one point five.

32
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:12,110
And then this as it moves from 300 back to zero this will basically move from point five back to 1.

33
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:19,530
Now let's apply our interpellation to our capacity so we'll say opacity patient are interpreted interpreted

34
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,380
and now want to refresh this we can see as it moves towards 300 it hits the point five of Pasotti and

35
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:31,380
then it goes back to one opacity.

36
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:38,160
Now let's do one more interpellation we could technically interpret all of this and interpolate but

37
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,210
we'll continue and off of our animated interpolate up above.

38
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:53,190
So I say Konst translate X interpret Zucco to animated inter-family interpret and that will take an

39
00:03:53,190 --> 00:04:03,130
input range and an output range and the range will be something crazy like input range 0 30 50 80 100

40
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,470
150 200 Nine-Nine and 300.

41
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,410
It doesn't matter how many values are in your output range.

42
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,350
You must just have the same amount of values in the output range.

43
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,540
And so for output range it doesn't even matter what the values are here either.

44
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,130
So we would say 0 and do the exact opposite.

45
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:31,170
Negative 30 negative 50 jump all the way back to 80 back to negative would go to 300 and then 0 and

46
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,280
then negative 100.

47
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:38,710
So these are close together so in a very quick span of time it will drop from zero to negative 100.

48
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:47,500
So now we can take this and put it into a new transform translate X and refresh this.

49
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,000
And so when we press on this all at the same time we will go from zero to 300.

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,830
Translate why our Passey will go from 1 to point five and back to 1 and then we will do this crazy sequence

51
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,610
of events.
