1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,960
Interpolations take more than just input range and output range.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:12,400
They also take an extrapolate value this extrapolate value defaults to extend which just says it's going

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,810
to extend the range beyond whatever the output range is.

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,490
So let's take a look at a quick example of this.

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,010
We have our animation that goes to.

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:28,530
And then once it's completed it will animate to one back to its beginning.

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,700
And because we have to find the input range from one to two and our output range from one to two these

8
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,810
will this map linearly to the values.

9
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:45,260
So if we refresh this and press on it as we animated to will animate to the two times the scale and

10
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,050
then back down to one with this animation here.

11
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:55,520
So let's take a look if we comment out this two and switch it to two values of three.

12
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,990
Now our input range does not go to three.

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,670
And so what will happen is it will analyze this step range between 1 and 2 to the output range of 1

14
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,570
and 2 and then figure out what this third value will be.

15
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:16,790
So now if we refreshed this and press on it rather than animating to to animate to three times a scale

16
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,220
this can be something that is beneficial.

17
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,490
However there are times where you want a separate thing to happen.

18
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,940
So for example there's extrapolate clamp extrapolate clamp will take a look at the output range and

19
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:38,250
once the input range is beyond it on either the left or right side whatever this is at it will not be

20
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,770
onto or go be on one.

21
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:46,670
So now if we refresh even though we're animating to 3 would be over here and with the default of extend

22
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,390
it would figure out that we need to go to a a scale of three.

23
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,680
It will stop at two

24
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:02,730
the other extrapolation value is identity what identity will do is once the input range has exceeded

25
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:09,390
rather than clamping like we have here it will just assume the value of the animated value.

26
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:17,670
So let's switch it over to identity and rather than animating 2 to 1 to 2 for output range we'll do

27
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,810
one 1.1.

28
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,160
So once your input range and our estimate of value is exceeded at the 2.

29
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:30,480
It will immediately skip to a scale of 2 and then animate to 3 and we can see that by refreshing here

30
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,330
slowly to one point one hits two and continues to three.

31
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:43,590
However when this animates backwards to 1 from 3 Once it is then within the two range.

32
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:50,180
Now our IMPA range in our output range in our interpellation will kick in and we can see it do it step

33
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,810
backwards as well.

34
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,730
Let's switch back to how we can see that we also have extrapolate left and extrapolate right.

35
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,900
So you can define how something should happen on the left and the right.

36
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:10,130
So let's switch this and put an extrapolate left with a clamp and we'll add instead of a two value of

37
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:10,640
one.

38
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,640
What added to a value of zero.

39
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,640
However we're still animating to a value of three to begin.

40
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:22,510
And because we are not defining and extrapolate right of clamp this will then continue on to three.

41
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:29,060
And once it tries to animate back down to zero which would then continue this along and animate this

42
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,940
value this box to disappear.

43
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,290
It will stop at one.

44
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:40,240
So we can see that we press this enemy to three sheets back down to one but our animated values actually

45
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,230
down at zero.

46
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,740
And that's because you've defined and extrapolate left side.

47
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,810
So over here of clamp.
