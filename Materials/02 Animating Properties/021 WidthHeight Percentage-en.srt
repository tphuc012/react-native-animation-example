1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:07,020
Percentage with based lay out options like using with 20 percent and high of 20 percent in this case

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,780
we're not at it until later in re-act native.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,620
And that was because of the additions to yoga.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:20,350
However interpolate did not need to be fixed to be able to interpret the width and height with animated.

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:27,060
We already have our animated values set up so we'll say Konst with interpret as you get to this state

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:33,210
animation interpret and input range will just be 0 to 1.

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:40,530
But our output range will be 20 percent that will be our default to start to 50 percent of the width

8
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:51,660
and then we'll set up our Konst height and interpolate So this state animation inter-relate input range

9
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:59,300
of zero to one in an output range of 20 percent to 30 percent.

10
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:05,140
And now with our interpretations we will build out our enemy cells so we'll see conc animated style

11
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:14,540
sequel to with passing or with interpretive and height height inter-relate and then pass that into our

12
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,710
box.

13
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,590
And we already have width and height of 20 percent done here.

14
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:24,270
However we don't need that anymore because we have defined our percentages inside of our tribulation

15
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,100
and inside of this dynamic style.

16
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,300
The reason that we're not animating to the exact values is because these width and height percentages

17
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,130
are of width and height.

18
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:34,820
They are different.

19
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,650
So this is 50 percent of the width.

20
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,320
And this will be 30 percent of the height.

21
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:50,530
We'll start by now setting up our star animation with our animated timing and say this animation to

22
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:58,860
value of one over 2300 milliseconds and then we'll call start.

23
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:04,830
And now when we press on it we can see that it grows to 50 percent width and 30 percent of the height.
