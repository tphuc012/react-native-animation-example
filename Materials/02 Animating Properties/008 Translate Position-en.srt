1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,790
In some cases you may need to move items across the screen whether it be in a drag or just animating

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,160
them across a screen before they disappear.

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:12,560
The appropriate way to use to do this is to use translate.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,580
It operates the most performance without also affecting layout.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:26,180
We're going to start by setting up state again and say animation is equal to a new animated value and

6
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,960
we're going to set it to zero so that our translate does not start anywhere and does not offset our

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,040
particular view.

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:42,340
We'll then set up our dynamic styles so say Konst animated styles is equal to an object to do a translation.

9
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:49,010
You need to use the transform style and the transform style takes an array of different objects and

10
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,420
each object should have a key.

11
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:58,850
And in our case we'll use translate Y and we'll pass in this state to animation we'll then pass our

12
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,070
animated styles into our animated view.

13
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:08,030
And we see here we have our array syntax set up so we can combine multiple styles and then finally we'll

14
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,370
switch or start we'll create our start animation

15
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:23,560
and will once again use animated talk timing say this outstate animation to value of three hundred a

16
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,880
duration of fifteen hundred milliseconds and then we'll call start.

17
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:38,310
So now when we refresh and we press on our box we can see that it animates 300 pixels down translate

18
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:44,810
uses a grid where the 0 0 is the starting Top left point of the particular element.

19
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:50,240
So when you animate the y value 300 positive it will go down.

20
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:56,900
And if you were to translate X it would go from left to right in a positive fashion.

21
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:02,240
So we'll try that we'll switch or translate y to translate X and then we press this it will translate

22
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,870
300 pixels to the right off the screen.

23
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,050
Now switch this back to translate Y.

24
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:16,420
And in order to make this item go up we need to change this value to negative 300 so positive values

25
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:23,890
will go down for the translate Y and for translate X they will go from left to right and then if you

26
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,950
do a negative value it will go up.

27
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:33,430
So let's refresh this and animate from zero to negative 300 and you can see that now our box goes up

28
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,420
rather than down.

29
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:43,590
Now we'll switch this back to just 300 and we'll then pass our finish callback function into start and

30
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:52,710
then rather than animating we'll just say this state animation value of zero and that way we won't do

31
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,750
any sort of timing animation.

32
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,740
We will just literally set the value back to zero.

33
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:04,080
So once this hits the end it'll just reset right back to where it was to be being press on this and

34
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,340
it jumps right back.
