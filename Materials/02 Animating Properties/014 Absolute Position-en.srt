1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:06,850
Absolutely positioning items we'll take it out of the normal flow of a particular view.

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,570
So in this case we've positioned it at left and zero.

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,810
However we have a container that says a line items to the center but it is not respecting that because

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,280
it is absolutely positioned

5
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:23,410
Typically you'd want to use translate to move things around the screen because it's going to be more

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,250
performant but in some cases you may need to use absolute position.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:35,750
So we'll start by setting up our state with an animation and this time we will set it to zero as our

8
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:44,810
default will then say Konst animated styles and we'll say top is this state animation and we're also

9
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:51,620
control the left which is this does state that animation will then pass in our enemy and tiles into

10
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,670
our animated view.

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:01:00,110
Because we are controlling that we don't necessarily need this left and zero top inside of our styles.

12
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:08,590
However we will leave it just for examples later well then go ahead and set up our start animation and

13
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,870
say animated timing.

14
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:19,270
Sequel to this state animation and we'll say to value of 300 over the duration of fifteen hundred milliseconds

15
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,110
and then call start.

16
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:26,630
So now when we refresh this and when we press on our box you can see that it translates at this are

17
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:34,880
absolutely positions at the same time it animates from 1 0 0 to 300 on both top and left.

18
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,670
If we were to move one of these for example or for your move top it would just animate left.

19
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,070
And same goes for left.

20
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,990
We'll just animate the top.

21
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,390
Let's bring back our left.

22
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,450
And you can additionally animate more than just top and left.

23
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:02,060
For example if we were to remove the width here and set right of zero and animate rather than 300 to

24
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,890
40 and then pass in.

25
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:05,540
Right.

26
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:12,010
This state animation when this animation happens what's going to happen is this is going to take up

27
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:18,250
the entire screen because we set it at top left right zero with a height of 150.

28
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:24,130
But then it's going to animate to 40 in from the left and from the top and from the right at the same

29
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:24,710
time.

30
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,840
So you press this and see that we can both animate the left top and right at the same exact time.
