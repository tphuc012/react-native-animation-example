                    <p class="lead"><p>Interpolation is a method of constructing data points from within a range of a discrete set of known data points. What that means is given a value and at least 2 other numbers we can figure out where in the range we are. </p>

<p>This is great for deriving animations from a single animated value. When interpolating it allows us to connect animations. When the animations are connected with interpolate it requires you to control a singular value and drive a range of animations. Meaning less work for us, and better animations.</p>





<p>An example of this would be a Modal. With a singular <code>Animated.Value</code> and interpolation you could connect the opacity, and position of the modal. This would allow you to have the exact same animation forwards, and operate in reverse. Interpolations can be extremely powerful to use. </p>





<p>We'll explore a few use cases, and later jump into examples that use interpolate heavily.</p></p>
