1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,360
Skill is a way to control the size of a particular element without actually controlling its layout.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:15,020
Additionally scale can be used for other things like flipping items over on a reflection point to start

3
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:22,670
we'll create our state and create an animation and create another enemy to add value because the zero

4
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,670
scale would be non-existent.

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:31,610
The item would not appear on our screen will default one because that is going to be what scale defaults

6
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:38,360
to meaning it's just going to be a normal size of whatever the layout defined for then go set up Konst

7
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:47,120
animated styles and scale is going to be another transform objects will say transform which is an array

8
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:54,220
and pass and scale and say this Stut state animation and then we'll pass our enemy of styles into our

9
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,000
box.

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:05,790
And then create our start animation function for our touch without feedback and we'll say animated timing.

11
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:11,510
And so this state animation set to value of two.

12
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:20,610
So basically I will double its size say duration of 1300 milliseconds and then call start and now when

13
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,990
we refresh and we press on our box you can see that it grows to twice the size.

14
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,960
Besides growing larger scale also allows you to only scale the x value.

15
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:38,160
So if we refreshed this we can scale just horizontally or if we switched to scale why

16
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,370
it then scale vertically.

17
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:49,650
We'll flip this back to Y and change this to negative 2 rather than 2.

18
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,640
Additionally.

19
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,570
And some text inside of our animated view.

20
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,730
So I'll say this side forward

21
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,300
and then we'll also have to close our animated view.

22
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,400
So now enter refresh we will have some text inside of it.

23
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,180
However because we're animating to negative to what's going to happen is this is going to animate out

24
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,840
and then reflect and be the opposite direction.

25
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,710
So we press this is now flipped upside down.

26
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,570
This works for both scale x and scale y.

27
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:29,070
So if we change this to scale x we can see that it does a flip card animation to two times the size

28
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,150
but reversed.

29
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:40,370
Same goes for scale Y when we refresh it or flip over its horizontal axis and then all be scaled to

30
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,410
two times its size.

31
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,320
But in reverse.
