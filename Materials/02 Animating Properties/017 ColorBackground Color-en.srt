1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,360
Animated allows us to also use interpellation to control colors whether it be back on colors or text

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,770
colors.

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:15,030
We're going to start by setting up state is equal to animation and our new animated value.

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:21,000
And we're just going to it to zero then we're going to come down to our render function and we're going

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,830
to first set up our box interpellation that will be a box that you currently don't see because it doesn't

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,360
have a background color.

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:33,880
So it's a contest box interpellation is equal to this state animation.

8
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:43,970
Inter-relate and they will take a configuration object configuration object takes a few different properties.

9
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,000
The first one is input range this input range is going to be an array.

10
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,090
And it requires items to be in order so 0 to 1.

11
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,130
And this is defining a range of our animation.

12
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:01,080
So when you have zero there will be a direct correlation.

13
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,140
And when you have one there will be another direct correlation.

14
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:11,280
However it will figure out when the animation is between 0 and 1 what color to pick in it does that

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,610
by using the output range which also takes an array and we can pass in our colors.

16
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,780
This is our tomato color.

17
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:26,870
However interplay only works with our G-B our DPA and other various items.

18
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,220
But everything but Hexe but interpolate actually does returns a new animated value.

19
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:40,050
However when the value is requested by the animated view it'll figure out what color or what output

20
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,210
range it actually needs to be.

21
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:52,320
So in this case we'll set up a contest box animated style and say background color and we'll pass in

22
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,390
our box interpellation.

23
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,650
Then take our box animated style and apply it to our view.

24
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:08,780
And now when we refresh we can see that the default value is zero which then hits this particular input

25
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,960
range and output this particular color which happens to be tomato.

26
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,120
We then pass a background color and into our enemy to view.

27
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,170
And here we are now styling our background color.

28
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,820
You can interpolate more than once on this same animation.

29
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:33,640
So we're going to say Konst color interpellation or this state animation inter-relate which then will

30
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,770
take our input range of 0 and 1 and then an output range.

31
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:44,260
And in this case we're going to do the reverse so we're going to do the other color here and then trend's

32
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:54,940
interpret to our tomato color this color interpellation will then be passed into our Konst text animated

33
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:03,080
style and say color pass and our color interpretation then we'll take that and put it here.

34
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,990
On our animated Texas style is equal to Tex animated style.

35
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:15,270
So now one refreshed we can see that we have a tomato background with a purple interior color.

36
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:25,560
And now we're ready to go set up our start animation Well then say animated timing pass in this state

37
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,430
to animation.

38
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:33,880
So to value of one over the course of 1300 milliseconds and then call start

39
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:50,230
now when we refresh and we press on our box you can see that it transitions from blue to orange and

40
00:03:50,230 --> 00:04:03,630
then if we enter a back and say animated timing state to animation to value of 0 rather than one over

41
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:11,470
the course of 1300 milliseconds and then call start refreshed this press.

42
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,940
You see that goes one way and then comes back.

43
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:23,210
This shows that over the course of this animated timing this value of this state's animation that we're

44
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:28,490
interpretating on is not always going to be exactly zero or exactly what it's going to be a range and

45
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:35,720
interpolate takes the output ranges and the values that are in between 0 1 and then figures out the

46
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,790
exact color that it interprets to.

47
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,440
And it does not matter which direction that this is animating as we can see that it happened both going

48
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,040
forward to one and backwards to zero.

49
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:56,800
It will only just figure out between these two ranges and does not care about which direction the animation

50
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,480
is occurring.
