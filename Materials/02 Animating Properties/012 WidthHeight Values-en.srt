1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,600
Sometimes you need to estimate the width and the height of a particular element.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:11,740
This will cause layout changes to happen for that particular element as well as any surrounding elements.

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,970
We have a box that is width of 150 and height of 150.

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:23,840
So we're going to say state equals animation create a new animated value and we're going to default

5
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:36,360
250 will then create animated styles and say with is the cause of this state animation as well as height

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,590
is you input of this state to animation particularly animations animated values can control more than

7
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,900
one property at the same time.

8
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:53,250
So he can pass in any minute styles to our animated view because we're now passing and animated styles

9
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,830
and defining the default value in this dynamic styles.

10
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,290
That means we can technically remove the width and height definition from our box as it will be overridden

11
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,070
by the animated styles because we've put that second.

12
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,340
So now onery fresh we can see that nothing has actually changed.

13
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:21,490
And now we'll create our start animation function and then say animated timing pass in this state animation

14
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:29,560
see to value of 300 and then pass in our duration of 1100 milliseconds and then call start.

15
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:37,650
So now when we refresh and press on our box it will grow width and height at the same time.

16
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:44,330
However if we were to remove one of these nothing would happen because we have removed the defaults

17
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:50,900
here so we'll move this and say height of 150 static and then we can just grow with end or alternatively

18
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:59,260
if we switch these we could also just grow right and back with in height that are both animated and

19
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,370
will show that this actually affects layout.

20
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:13,420
So we're going to add some text to the child of the box.

21
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,810
So now we're in refresh we can see that we have some text here rendering inside of our box.

22
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:23,470
And then when we animate it we can see that this text is going to reflow because the width of our box

23
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,240
is growing.
